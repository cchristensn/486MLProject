0,0,224517,Brass: Birmingham,2018,8.41324,"Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace' 2007 masterpiece, Brass. Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&#10;&#10;It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&#10;&#10;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&#10;&#10;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&#10;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&#10;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&#10;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&#10;5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&#10;&#10;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&#10;&#10;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card.

1,1,161936,Pandemic Legacy: Season 1,2015,8.3759,"Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.&#10;&#10;After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.&#10;&#10;Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.&#10;&#10;During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,60,"['Action Points', 'Cooperative Game', 'Hand Management', 'Legacy Game', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Set Collection', 'Tags', 'Trading', 'Variable Player Powers']",13,60,2.8294,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Environmental', 'Medical']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2024,14,91,187,0.1253780800057094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2886202242552476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22225636042758515,0.0,0.23002927586864902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1424235892383213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09719995160657874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1300190178451046,0.1264841713832113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2333860256238741,0.0,0.0,0.2496747114278003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13606000058580275,0.10662506529372578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.221522721646731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11845230383105032,0.10007944024327217,0.18953167001240856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11669301281193704,0.0,0.0,0.0918263097134468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1424235892383213,0.09160970241818255,0.11301970305243542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11460683232720792,0.0,0.14420434348776587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1424235892383213,0.0,0.10829194044258912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13990547208964518,0.0,0.0,0.09054553892826285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10534429450854182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10795241964889203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12175116138321485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09012841184947601,0.0,0.0,0.1300190178451046,0.0,0.0952398445533422,0.0,0.0,0.11542705161191327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11149872372259709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10350365801083827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12377936215419993,0.0,0.0,0.1158441786907001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1391032810701256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10380405659653481,0.0,0.0,0.1253780800057094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12175116138321485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1424235892383213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10350365801083827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11149872372259709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13754993080945,0.10761602812360915,0.0,0.0,0.09980807674692893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20407533779600914,0.0
2,2,174430,Gloomhaven,2017,8.34456,"Gloomhaven  is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.&#10;&#10;This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player&rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.&#10;&#10;",1,4,60,120,"['Action Queue', 'Action Retrieval', 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Communication Limits', 'Cooperative Game', 'Critical Hits and Failures', 'Deck Construction', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Legacy Game', 'Line of Sight', 'Modular Board', 'Multi-Use Cards', 'Narrative Choice / Paragraph', 'Once-Per-Game Abilities', 'Role Playing', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Storytelling', 'Tags', 'Variable Player Powers']",14,120,3.911,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures']",False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1591,12,52,152,0.12339401157797175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13769151228081608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1007069142684997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13690201568024735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1339068941462404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41549625556494263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0792464780718066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13769151228081608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1410353807223406,0.14192235539986658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09016000787640872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10657825476483106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1279615080451445,0.12735778544210868,0.0,0.0,0.1851551996627929,0.0,0.08576422872129306,0.0,0.08911268443685672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1331955709156218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08870215826205037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18247757425882014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09373270416139869,0.09849571478150651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35107217581020395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10973429171453815,0.0,0.0,0.0893197204527414,0.0,0.11702405860340132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08890683488029784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10216139026000375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13249806066318337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08357549192513729,0.0,0.12286184407691442,0.0,0.3785398611461647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08117989444944568,0.0,0.11047494989926962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14016978102272282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12080867673797702,0.3012688652629615,0.0

4,4,233078,Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition,2017,8.2371,"Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition) is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;No two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.&#10;&#10;A round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.&#10;&#10;After every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",3,6,240,480,"['Action Drafting', 'Area-Impulse', 'Dice Rolling', 'Follow', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Increase Value of Unchosen Resources', 'King of the Hill', 'Modular Board', 'Movement Points', 'Race', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks', 'Trading', 'Variable Phase Order', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up', 'Voting']",14,480,4.3248,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Civilization', 'Economic', 'Exploration', 'Negotiation', 'Political', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration', 'Wargame']",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2769,19,73,225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06840335914925669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08789534858822015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07512478020332633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09687564753839153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09748490066193682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08164812018441446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07614238825185322,0.09513326514589218,0.0,0.0,0.05497822272448177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07390909108181794,0.09101145654789389,0.0,0.0,0.10886706355559377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09457878118544691,0.35821938856565766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09687564753839153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06747217324808803,0.0,0.0,0.08874624317920748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06192991503521375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05891050281463087,0.0,0.2448420804620797,0.06178434825402024,0.08588826712842211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07121476258680286,0.09298639012321515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06267091660623964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07888671372009619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07463129379643318,0.0,0.08918295365663366,0.09513326514589218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07537527471876926,0.09628107665142668,0.0,0.18405819261429018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08512902267460926,0.0,0.26495138415863645,0.08439244565265744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07614238825185322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19867461509125484,0.0,0.0,0.08230611912133619,0.27303436964368166,0.0,0.0,0.08550572461533264,0.0,0.19375129507678307,0.05917022624278487,0.28373634355634075,0.0,0.1464148554919195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09513326514589218,0.0,0.0,0.09008027064672523,0.28884322995428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14416117638111545,0.0,0.0,0.06997045702849913,0.0,0.0,0.0758840246571392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2621578107277739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09298639012321515,0.0,0.09628107665142668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
5,5,316554,Dune: Imperium,2020,8.2321,"Dune: Imperium is a game that uses deck-building to add a hidden-information angle to traditional worker placement. It finds inspiration in elements and characters from the Dune legacy, both the new film from Legendary Pictures and the seminal literary series from Frank Herbert, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Anderson.&#10;&#10;As a leader of one of the Great Houses of the Landsraad, raise your banner and marshal your forces and spies. War is coming, and at the center of the conflict is Arrakis &ndash; Dune, the desert planet.&#10;&#10;You start with a unique leader card, as well as a deck identical to those of your opponents.  As you acquire cards and build your deck, your choices will define your strengths and weaknesses. Cards allow you to send your Agents to certain spaces on the game board, so how your deck evolves affects your strategy. You might become more powerful militarily, able to deploy more troops than your opponents. Or you might acquire cards that give you an edge with the four political factions represented in the game: the Emperor, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit, and the Fremen.&#10;&#10;Unlike many deck-building games, you don&rsquo;t play your entire hand in one turn. Instead, you draw a hand of cards at the start of every round and alternate with other players, taking one Agent turn at a time (playing one card to send one of your Agents to the game board). When it&rsquo;s your turn and you have no more Agents to place, you&rsquo;ll take a Reveal turn, revealing the rest of your cards, which will provide Persuasion and Swords. Persuasion is used to acquire more cards, and Swords help your troops fight for the current round&rsquo;s rewards as shown on the revealed Conflict card.&#10;&#10;Defeat your rivals in combat, shrewdly navigate the political factions, and acquire precious cards. The Spice must flow to lead your House to victory!&#10;&#10;Some important links: The Official FAQ, the Unofficial FAQ, and an Automa (solo and 2p) Overview&#10;&#10;",1,4,60,120,"['Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Delayed Purchase', 'Force Commitment', 'Increase Value of Unchosen Resources', 'Multi-Use Cards', 'Open Drafting', 'Race', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Tags', 'Take That', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Worker Placement']",14,120,3.0515,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Novel-based', 'Political', 'Science Fiction']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2005,16,96,181,0.0,0.11235342718594153,0.44257990845099004,0.0,0.0,0.10202112843805694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09885366680418385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09738546093067826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08111764244960848,0.16983206481862614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10329933169622495,0.0,0.0,0.10555661417740775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11608781723560167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38046991733774727,0.11959275705106255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08898331511182779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08844419706352998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07908626489430867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08329423779869961,0.0,0.0,0.10955702665646094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10039624323086505,0.0,0.15290466636755415,0.09431992208263482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1085065993026135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07272487596094847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21205772400448805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09124059759301056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.200006427179922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07521613093541936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08352070259324336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10418227393921205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12034487858664121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1514796014058826,0.0,0.39692819597484097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0966770714550927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1181420364676771,0.0,0.0,0.16350889398635687,0.0,0.0,0.10160670878605416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10555661417740775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07086890856772601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08637836319850055,0.0,0.09037439586957255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08090829884512597,0.0,0.11479147799919448,0.0,0.0,0.08981031725726805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
6,6,167791,Terraforming Mars,2016,8.2077,"In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.&#10;&#10;The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards and actually playing them. Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards. Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!&#10;&#10;",1,5,120,120,"['Closed Drafting', 'Contracts', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Hand Management', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Income', 'Set Collection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Tags', 'Take That', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks', 'Tile Placement', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up', 'Victory Points as a Resource']",12,120,3.2642,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Environmental', 'Industry / Manufacturing', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration', 'Territory Building']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2578,20,114,204,0.0,0.0,0.1079242183406038,0.1647346256977445,0.07831446494030483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10686302057408989,0.0,0.0,0.0904608538333367,0.0,0.09362451837918019,0.0,0.0,0.09263955373951464,0.0,0.09499075351584094,0.0,0.1166519724684966,0.09016225454738763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11388622073030738,0.11455389779189762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09499075351584094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32707418566783764,0.09716565438373392,0.10388950310203292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11455389779189762,0.0,0.0,0.19860465307594075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0832958377569395,0.09534235973621996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07714153450905126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14949738878225308,0.0,0.10686302057408989,0.0,0.0,0.09329255538521396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07457237115035685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09951243001012022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11593602508131337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21280971617911246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07546464177830975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10902472855594589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16293385886733272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3705582149580586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07387735983540007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07974410603941072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10296097819396567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09168619775698311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10959065764525949,0.09329255538521396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07124931577765903,0.11388622073030738,0.0,0.35260836187038047,0.0,0.0,0.10162043296713476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10846937820232073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.086795216370407,0.0,0.10634630530896126,0.08425432019602194,0.0,0.0,0.18275018294138964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0789187646650268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1752037650843454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10533907736449441,0.0,0.0,0.09992223483650778,0.08306097187877079,0.11016757633294771
7,7,115746,War of the Ring: Second Edition,2011,8.189,"In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA). Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.&#10;&#10;The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle-earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle-earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle-earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.&#10;&#10;Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).&#10;&#10;Action Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.&#10;&#10;",2,4,150,180,"['Action Drafting', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Hand Management', 'Movement Points', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Set-up']",13,180,4.2165,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Novel-based', 'Territory Building', 'Wargame']",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1980,11,68,163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30897932847454146,0.19585075640783325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11311337351319502,0.1458630730723592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13362284622269094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14496784358036863,0.0,0.12599055610950533,0.0,0.0,0.12874368403812342,0.0,0.0,0.13703351744416847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12293539215787266,0.0,0.14000712213977556,0.12494400165798425,0.1304991393988498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21509562697939474,0.263434577467461,0.08277924042233115,0.0,0.10852981496894075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2170596299378815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09346669448714943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14000712213977556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11274000126286719,0.0,0.09173846538355841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3914974181965494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09694120869769951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10886300308749941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12342745532768548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1053526468807312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10565841178537877,0.14678040921552182,0.09971301916440227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10504937804395828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2712629114456051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12392612356929071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11022646716778456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09868100207413048,0.0,0.2800142442795511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
8,8,187645,Star Wars: Rebellion,2016,8.16967,"Star Wars: Rebellion is a board game of epic conflict between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance for two to four players.&#10;&#10;Experience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&#10;&#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&#10;&#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!&#10;&#10;",2,4,180,240,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Area-Impulse', 'Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Contracts', 'Delayed Purchase', 'Dice Rolling', 'Die Icon Resolution', 'Events', 'Hand Management', 'Hidden Movement', 'Income', 'Once-Per-Game Abilities', 'Tags', 'Take That', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up', 'Worker Placement, Different Worker Types']",14,240,3.7414,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Civil War', 'Miniatures', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,2501,18,99,221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12353860239228423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1465787831453948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09942178452170063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12937539396692826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12353860239228423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08318541543949334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11980223545829699,0.0,0.22658637102378257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1465787831453948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13699478634022522,0.0,0.12115993097667983,0.0,0.09693202797199937,0.0,0.14480070842715895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1465787831453948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12504212822174046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14750062040528417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11076731819474718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13299104127377187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08913519585641905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1299542041993741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1342784968614364,0.0,0.0,0.45317274204756514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1216236948556327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1336292194150935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12714592491100907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14310348379393703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4220822960055789,0.11042003650752764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40835810865514494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

10,10,162886,Spirit Island,2017,8.14551,"In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.&#10;&#10;Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.&#10;&#10;The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming towns and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present. The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.&#10;&#10;The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history. At game start, winning requires destroying every last explorer, town and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if explorers or even towns and cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.&#10;&#10;The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.&#10;&#10;",1,4,90,120,"['Action Retrieval', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Automatic Resource Growth', 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Cooperative Game', 'Hand Management', 'Modular Board', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Tags', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up']",13,120,4.0673,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Environmental', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Mythology', 'Territory Building']",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2619,19,100,228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08693871458132821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09319564963451109,0.15021172478708553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08610515048515276,0.0,0.06437070975420497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1355311318295077,0.0,0.17831558296998687,0.07727999792082733,0.09549938849268307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08915779148499343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09010579390322337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060384197270942006,0.09490254425997872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21543384113648956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1467035176807448,0.0,0.21055403855543173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09549938849268307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15455999584165467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07966919696219268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07589842399761258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07844508915485277,0.0,0.0,0.4481357266280137,0.0,0.0778555242365537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08962714532560274,0.05996382209612942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07149153633953702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059687579508809145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39372676714916044,0.0,0.43683265204912164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09109250083460751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06487604446569842,0.0,0.18980508851995745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06854534203145861,0.05462585690590861,0.0717163841311805,0.07433846577175654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12840917128234955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09109250083460751,0.0,0.09432008322514006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08569890624514781,0.0,0.0,0.08129201858707227,0.06757449011100708,0.0

To do all of that, each group has special skills and abilities.&#10;&#10;The playing area is made of ten sectors, allowing a variable set-up and thus an even bigger replay value than its predecessor Terra Mystica. A two-player game is hosted on seven sectors.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",1,4,60,150,"['End Game Bonuses', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Income', 'Modular Board', 'Network and Route Building', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Tags', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks', 'Turn Order: Pass Order', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up', 'Victory Points as a Resource']",12,150,4.3961,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Civilization', 'Economic', 'Miniatures', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration', 'Territory Building']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1031,7,52,101,0.1822528740625981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20106318036165738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16372698091075114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3546546921832006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16100562669506163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20703067451513815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20578226925887438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20220418725038156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39855979196671565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1822528740625981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14547810604598346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16047771412601936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13131533672932125,0.0,0.3835355335219256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16372698091075114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30178461264063955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20830916470299765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.157416012293208,0.0,0.17992893575344934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
12,12,12333,Twilight Struggle,2005,8.06504,"Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are &ndash; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle. &ndash; John F. Kennedy&#10;&#10;In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors.&#10;&#10;Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.&#10;&#10;Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources? Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:     approx. 3-5 years per turn&#10;MAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system&#10;UNIT SCALE:     Influence markers&#10;&#10;",2,2,120,180,"['Action / Event', 'Advantage Token', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Hand Management', 'Simulation', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Sudden Death Ending', 'Tug of War', 'Variable Set-up']",13,180,3.6098,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Modern Warfare', 'Political', 'Wargame']",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2333,20,108,236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10926945385380611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1173407572713412,0.0,0.0,0.12808949918422807,0.09900250965250236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.107955581092872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09146285242024937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08945462275876474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10430443470008588,0.0,0.0892120682526956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12808949918422807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10752912494465482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12161534872072292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11621569989327368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08407974181618286,0.12505257021066754,0.07789178182501173,0.36290795723934555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09416053988854438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1954459908632832,0.09900250965250236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1145976775169082,0.1265357088246434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08945462275876474,0.0,0.20634574559971722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1179181781997521,0.0,0.0,0.1179181781997521,0.0,0.0,0.10172270380039589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11063846999852534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10926945385380611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12033583449986218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07590395296512001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07372825152526327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3688413067002753,0.0,0.1229471022334251,0.09619109754404558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5472297500625771,0.0

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&#10;&#10;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.&#10;&#10;",2,4,120,120,"['Action Points', 'Auction / Bidding', 'Auction: Dutch', 'Events', 'Income', 'Open Drafting', 'Tags', 'Take That']",14,120,4.4365,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Civilization', 'Economic']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1609,14,55,139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11949847713018252,0.14584765283952852,0.0,0.11342421987672674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2986103258684248,0.3125929618202444,0.1262250317562238,0.14326899660938094,0.0,0.0,0.14584765283952852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12839234556686188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13129113815057195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11195831863006435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08245652335504836,0.0,0.3598223944789429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2953424378564509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2650333608577255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08923828920418536,0.1385909376823185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22684843975345348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12271063481058253,0.09493460611594065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09229522576070252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34962199532543736,0.0,0.12176436424834455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13378377434097366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10568692229645883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08963172116092216,0.14326899660938094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1689365136597162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09927989667850434,0.0,0.0,0.1105477478017551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10220760343013728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Also, it might be a good idea to hire capable staff: cowboys to improve your herd, craftsmen to build your very own buildings, or engineers for the important railroad line.&#10;&#10;If you cleverly manage your herd and navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of Great Western Trail, you surely will gain the most victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",2,4,75,150,"['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Ownership', 'Set Collection', 'Track Movement', 'Variable Set-up']",12,150,3.7004,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['American West', 'Animals', 'Economic']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,858,6,41,94,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1737174695561715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13980489087148257,0.0,0.3545800381538838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3356844041995014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16200327678334486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1678422020997507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3833160307509755,0.3460624693947982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17583169699154513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.170372630200516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20361581053047514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13145459580237157,0.18273895830564485,0.0,0.1811235625685106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1587882180108584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12214137059822591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11864032558679216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16037113851085738,0.0,0.0,0.27888818138833205,0.16602134144610325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14355621630528198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
15,15,84876,The Castles of Burgundy,2011,8.01563,"For the 2019 edition see The Castles of Burgundy.&#10;&#10;The game is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&#10;&#10;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&#10;&#10;The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the fifth phase is played to completion.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;The rules include basic and advanced versions.&#10;&#10;This game is #14 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;There is a separate BGG entry for the 2019 edition: The Castles of Burgundy.  The 2019 edition includes, alongside the base game, eight expansions, seven of which had already been released separately as promotional items and one new to the 2019 release.&#10;&#10;UPC 4005556812431&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,90,"['Dice Rolling', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Grid Coverage', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Open Drafting', 'Pattern Building', 'Tile Placement', 'Turn Order: Stat-Based', 'Variable Set-up']",12,90,2.9777,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Dice', 'Medieval', 'Territory Building']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3004,25,113,210,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04850232816200515,0.1383473764162692,0.0,0.0663015902231454,0.12464677449063596,0.0,0.056778992212950075,0.0,0.05789370534207661,0.0678577334102127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05513117955867434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06826940129283715,0.06869098983225697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12464677449063596,0.06202934540295022,0.04659187805448462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06706236563923006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059332467268019086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061175757685428045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25323632662111384,0.18608803620885064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1572187258516302,0.06453290579423232,0.0,0.0,0.0385968328769177,0.04904909384173911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050800061734667494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09594426743027352,0.04542510726972049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06387263582035918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054935701795541116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0678577334102127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06667784295644993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08680429647122749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12072377278622413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08640440462628661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13331298643463727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08640440462628661,0.11187138538402722,0.0,0.06232338724531798,0.0,0.09130463853146725,0.04797213371513676,0.0,0.0,0.05126662479188799,0.0,0.059839606480551845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05344585931421708,0.0,0.23250172645764794,0.08700596939598167,0.05362529758249333,0.0,0.049613500135813476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059839606480551845,0.05552881207930268,0.043301889635791915,0.0,0.06323638105655732,0.060628992005694084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06262245568671179,0.0,0.05859830034039413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06009879755882569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04947068238115891,0.060628992005694084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5743926218682321,0.3114523083595731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06745553000052118,0.0,0.0,0.06387263582035918,0.06826940129283715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051109717212868395,0.1283993122829288,0.06262245568671179,0.0,0.039538499315918484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06912298901035933,0.2788298189802312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040195668700011275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
16,16,169786,Scythe,2016,7.98392,"It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place). Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness. Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;",1,5,90,115,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Contracts', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Force Commitment', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'King of the Hill', 'Movement Points', 'Narrative Choice / Paragraph', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Take That', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up', 'Victory Points as a Resource', 'Zone of Control']",14,115,3.448,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Fighting', 'Science Fiction', 'Territory Building']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,2452,19,93,224,0.09936564613001042,0.0,0.0,0.08019237276602866,0.07624654184103317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10404126205385293,0.0,0.0,0.08807220073630813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09248248670252159,0.0,0.11357173296705735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15406737756318525,0.2419225343210734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20608743915650737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09248248670252159,0.11428598814691779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22048650612145365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09459995848950634,0.0,0.0,0.09571980924485375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10160908515128163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1289069480086578,0.0,0.1690067116370445,0.11428598814691779,0.10160908515128163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0877814860775644,0.0,0.08399138023965957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07931576431581709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09248248670252159,0.10841574867754669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09082913013652945,0.0,0.0,0.09534168797733422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09387677419549449,0.0,0.11024325306072683,0.10725855976668079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11087901195072279,0.0,0.0,0.32349410367527326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10725855976668079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10901217939688365,0.0,0.11219405044874464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09496844583018786,0.07347196933867065,0.0,0.0,0.09649121136143901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142929511830977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07931576431581709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09423610633272445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2705801137396004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08866254500321574,0.1884722126654489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07159411530820216,0.0,0.0,0.200484509160444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09936564613001042,0.11357173296705735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11087901195072279,0.0,0.0,0.13460187653478084,0.10560520320068865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08450335581852225,0.0,0.10353819085094601,0.08202955296969162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.327036538190651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
17,18,173346,7 Wonders Duel,2015,7.97102,"In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders. Over three ages, players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders. What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players.&#10;&#10;Players do not draft cards simultaneously from decks of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play, as it can with bonus moves that allow the player to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each acquired card can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder. Each player also starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.&#10;&#10;Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as they are acquired, the cost for those resources increases for the opponent, representing the owner's dominance in this area.&#10;&#10;You can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital (also giving you a bonus at certain positions). If you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately. Or if you acquire six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately. If none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",2,2,30,30,"['End Game Bonuses', 'Income', 'Layering', 'Market', 'Modular Board', 'Multi-Use Cards', 'Once-Per-Game Abilities', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection', 'Sudden Death Ending', 'Tags', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks', 'Tug of War', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up', 'Victory Points as a Resource']",10,30,2.2252,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Ancient', 'Card Game', 'City Building', 'Civilization', 'Economic']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1771,13,67,146,0.0,0.0,0.3490993467767411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10396540782464583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22823499042291856,0.0,0.0,0.08930705583003654,0.0,0.24558964228244493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1086409588537069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11816324326159122,0.0,0.10476631039829784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14276016124330923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14134577999336972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18716931691599328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08317582998061106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10242128075941602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07648549247296899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33013245327815427,0.0,0.08136776451295416,0.11004415109271809,0.11304958184561571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12006683892229875,0.39954464584385246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0796563195196055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1086409588537069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23157847258867728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09885823045571798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09110866339336159,0.0,0.08598198425922679,0.11004415109271809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15364540031705215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14906710533916856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09504767225375632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24145473224823275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26280419377882874,0.0,0.0,0.07360044492349924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
18,19,28720,Brass: Lancashire,2007,7.96254,"Brass: Lancashire &mdash; first published as Brass &mdash; is an economic strategy game that tells the story of competing cotton entrepreneurs in Lancashire during the industrial revolution. You must develop, build, and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize demand for iron, coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each half. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Build an industry tile&#10;    Build a rail or canal&#10;    Develop an industry&#10;    Sell cotton&#10;    Take a loan&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of a player's turn, they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, from lowest spent first to highest spent. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.&#10;&#10;After all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double-connection build (though expensive) is possible. At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned.&#10;&#10;The cards limit where you can build your industries, but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or build connections actions. This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source, which may be an opponent's coal mine, which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e., being utilized).&#10;&#10;Brass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been made optional.&#10;     The three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck and distant market tiles slightly to ensure a consistent experience.&#10;     Two-player rules have been created and are playable without the need for an alternate board.&#10;     The level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible.&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,120,"['Hand Management', 'Income', 'Loans', 'Market', 'Network and Route Building', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks', 'Turn Order: Stat-Based']",14,120,3.8543,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing', 'Post-Napoleonic', 'Transportation']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2923,21,151,224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12808460891924625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06909963791193019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15098820764722645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09539311980663522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38822075059228095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07767947801402449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18208901593559101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14555605994939674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1608015394060677,0.0681158634731844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28617935941990563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06308313085299046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13287923786456632,0.0,0.08825592634520636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08534524727284303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08870173535213573,0.0,0.0,0.1896152957631909,0.0,0.0,0.09423595305315237,0.0,0.09313140334069422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09259740581880108,0.06261738031191931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12054758088697665,0.12167767410968644,0.0,0.0,0.08382625835664786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08738812305360806,0.0,0.0,0.07373093286012,0.0,0.059996119887515145,0.0,0.0,0.08346089945368032,0.0,0.24684735155309076,0.08346089945368032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059996119887515145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19019599972870854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07119541140398356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07575676485961982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2416552995597039,0.0,0.0,0.20669901135678526,0.0,0.0652114053480314,0.0,0.33530503342659146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08104655485321335,0.0,0.0,0.06870133539822415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05826472002395459,0.0,0.07976752748464983,0.14417420896078953,0.05652855952371825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08870173535213573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14195501882492548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054908231944661885,0.07208710448039476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06453647558094802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07163716737742332,0.0,0.0,0.06643961893228316,0.07739531209397112,0.0,0.0,0.08655025005122421,0.0,0.0,0.09009045098464724
19,20,167355,Nemesis,2018,7.95341,"Playing Nemesis will take you into the heart of sci-fi survival horror in all its terror. A soldier fires blindly down a corridor, trying to stop the alien advance. A scientist races to find a solution in his makeshift lab. A traitor steals the last escape pod in the very last moment. Intruders you meet on the ship are not only reacting to the noise you make but also evolve as the time goes by. The longer the game takes, the stronger they become. During the game, you control one of the crew members with a unique set of skills, personal deck of cards, and individual starting equipment. These heroes cover all your basic SF horror needs. For example, the scientist is great with computers and research, but will have a hard time in combat. The soldier, on the other hand...&#10;&#10;Nemesis is a semi-cooperative game in which you and your crewmates must survive on a ship infested with hostile organisms. To win the game, you have to complete one of the two objectives dealt to you at the start of the game and get back to Earth in one piece. You will find many obstacles on your way: swarms of Intruders (the name given to the alien organisms by the ship AI), the poor physical condition of the ship, agendas held by your fellow players, and sometimes just cruel fate.&#10;&#10;The gameplay of Nemesis is designed to be full of climactic moments which, hopefully, you will find rewarding even when your best plans are ruined and your character meets a terrible fate.&#10;&#10;",1,5,90,180,"['Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Hidden Roles', 'Interrupts', 'Modular Board', 'Player Elimination', 'Semi-Cooperative Game', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Team-Based Game', 'Traitor Game', 'Variable Player Powers']",12,180,3.4719,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Horror', 'Miniatures', 'Science Fiction']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1483,16,53,154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1507147712781044,0.0,0.0,0.15507760432841053,0.0,0.0,0.14719481547986152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1727870188513045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18485942785059314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15862824903603862,0.0,0.0,0.16050605075327884,0.1808151013272153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12117283778482252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14719481547986152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1892719065753105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4722467711474122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18813058757229292,0.0,0.0,0.181795009799694,0.0,0.122031334880603,0.0,0.0,0.19044072987147528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15987200486628655,0.0,0.12174347753918897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3124650234775264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12500796318868485,0.0,0.11580783652225769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13299922130271155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12005131222001685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301866178147568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13715383753989333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22570475011409027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1617995626005402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13754978928700656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1434619110193451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13263859644693796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
20,22,177736,A Feast for Odin,2016,7.94361,"A Feast for Odin is a saga in the form of a board game. You are reliving the cultural achievements, mercantile expeditions, and pillages of those tribes we know as Viking today &mdash; a term that was used quite differently towards the end of the first millennium.&#10;&#10;When the northerners went out for a raid, they used to say they headed out for a viking. Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus.&#10;In what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason why the people of these times became such strong seafarers is due to their unfortunate agricultural situation. Crop shortfalls caused great distress.&#10;&#10;In this game, you will raid and explore new territories. You will also experience their day-to-day activities: collecting goods to achieve a financially secure position in society. In the end, the player whose possessions bear the greatest value will be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;--gameplay description from @StoryBoardGamer&#039;s review:&#10;A Feast for Odin is a points-driven game, with plethora of pathways to victory, with a range of risk balanced against reward. A significant portion of this is your central hall, which has a whopping -86 points of squares and a major part of your game is attempting to cover these up with various tiles. Likewise, long halls and island colonies can also offer large rewards, but they will have penalties of their own.&#10;&#10;Each year follows a familiar pattern of preparation, worker placement, and then meeting the requirements of your feast. The main phase of each year is a worker placement affair. You start with a selection of Vikings, and a large action board with a whopping 61 different options to choose from. Each of these will be arranged from left to right in one of four columns. Each column requires an additional Viking to activate, but they are proportionally more powerful.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, you will need to fill a feast table with food, alternating between plants and vegetable matter.

21,23,124361,Concordia,2013,7.94076,"Two thousand years ago, the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities. Guide one of these dynasties and send colonists to the remote realms of the Empire; develop your trade network; and appease the ancient gods for their favor &mdash; all to gain the chance to emerge victorious!&#10;&#10;Concordia is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-5 players aged 13 and up. Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:&#10;&#10;&#10;    They allow a player to choose actions during the game.&#10;    They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game. &#10;&#10;&#10;Concordia is a strategy game that requires advance planning and consideration of your opponent's moves. Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities. (One side of the game board shows the entire Roman Empire with 30 cities for 3-5 players, while the other shows Roman Italy with 25 cities for 2-4 players.) When all cards have been sold or after the first player builds their 15th house, the game ends.

And what can you afford to do later... assuming someone else doesn't take the action first!?&#10;&#10;Decks are small, and randomness in the game is heavily mitigated by the wealth of tactical decisions offered on the game board. With a variety of worker actions, artifacts, and equipment cards, the set-up for each game will be unique, encouraging players to explore new strategies to meet the challenge.&#10;&#10;Discover the Lost Ruins of Arnak!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",1,4,30,120,"['Contracts', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Market', 'Multi-Use Cards', 'Once-Per-Game Abilities', 'Resource to Move', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Worker Placement']",12,120,2.9216,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Ancient', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Travel']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1279,17,69,127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3459795267547416,0.32895575418141676,0.0,0.15764874029600479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13108827373832382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13300120646883096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23194293380249714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1643573269706224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20784604825986253,0.0,0.12837433609982898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16134886290747918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49307198091186727,0.0,0.1215262335092675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1350063636109209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13711309005507683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14818956011668277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15187328905046277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10721219220730725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.104167006979551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16134886290747918,0.0,0.10272412395777794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12582666519072852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12970917650458297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10296115569089538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14890067070828913,0.1623277070482855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11796860032711895,0.0,0.12342605938992261,0.0,0.0,0.16134886290747918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

29,34,251247,Barrage,2019,7.84996,"In the dystopic 1930s, the industrial revolution pushed the exploitation of fossil-based resources to the limit, and now the only thing powerful enough to quench the thirst for power of the massive machines and of the unstoppable engineering progress is the unlimited hydroelectric energy provided by the rivers.&#10;&#10;Barrage is a resource management strategic game in which players compete to build their majestic dams, raise them to increase their storing capacity, and deliver all the potential power through pressure tunnels connected to the energy turbines of their powerhouses.&#10;&#10;Each player represents one of the four international companies who are gathering machinery, innovative patents and brilliant engineers to claim the best locations to collect and exploit the water of a contested Alpine region crossed by rivers.&#10;&#10;Barrage includes two innovative and challenging mechanisms. First, the players must carefully plan their actions and handle their machinery, since both their action tokens and resources are stored on a Construction Wheel and will only be available after a full turn of the wheel. The better you manage your wheel, the earlier your resources and actions come back to you.&#10;&#10;Second, the water flow on the rivers depicted on the board is a shared and contested resource. Players have to intercept and store as much of the water as they can, build dams (upstream dams are expensive but can block part of the water before it reaches the downstream dams), raise the dams to increase their capacity, and build long tunnels to channel the water to their powerhouses. Water is never consumed &mdash; its flow is just used to produce energy &mdash;, it is instead released back to the rivers, so you have to strategically place your dams to recover the water diverted by you and the other players.&#10;&#10;Over five rounds, the players must fulfill power requirements represented by a common competitive power track and meet specific requests of personal contracts. At the same time, by placing a limited number of engineers, they attempt to enhance their machinery to acquire new and more efficient construction actions and to build and activate special unique-effect buildings to forward their own developing strategy.&#10;&#10;",1,4,60,120,"['Action Retrieval', 'Contracts', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Income', 'Network and Route Building', 'Ownership', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Turn Order: Stat-Based', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up', 'Worker Placement']",14,120,4.112,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Environmental', 'Industry / Manufacturing']",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2278,11,72,193,0.0,0.0,0.11555977142135722,0.0881947350813108,0.25156545416690823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12490500725024296,0.10024837899856491,0.0,0.19769961616840034,0.099193728889739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09654116273928484,0.11734410998868253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3388833895338629,0.0,0.10743658934390783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12569053764665655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12569053764665655,0.09989292988535457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10928130113057309,0.0,0.11673814186394355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10208775627282204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08723065025167226,0.08259923705747943,0.0,0.12338984638721119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09989292988535457,0.0,0.2513810752933131,0.11332640794296106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11332640794296106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15932124662313385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11442349475225795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07855719369202642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10612002775533187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07855719369202642,0.0,0.0,0.11332640794296106,0.12413840715172286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4145595470710229,0.10880999821893866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29758118666921696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09751014215538913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10788783612500213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12413840715172286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0904770783456279,0.12569053764665655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10612002775533187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07401686989028218,0.0,0.0,0.1226584954498281,0.0,0.0,0.1161435009120753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09021524670566973,0.0,0.0943887811408642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.&#10;&#10;c) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added.

32,38,183394,Viticulture Essential Edition,2015,7.83537,"In Viticulture, the players find themselves in the roles of people in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meagre vineyards. They have a few plots of land, an old crush pad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.&#10;&#10;The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.&#10;&#10;Fortunately for the vineyard owners, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.

36,42,256960,Pax Pamir: Second Edition,2019,7.79247,"In Pax Pamir, players assume the role of nineteenth century Afghan leaders attempting to forge a new state after the collapse of the Durrani Empire. Western histories often call this period &quot;The Great Game&quot; because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.&#10;&#10;In terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.&#10;&#10;To survive, players will organize into coalitions. Throughout the game, the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card, called a &quot;Dominance Check&quot;, is resolved. If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks, those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition. However, if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks, players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base.&#10;&#10;After each Dominance Check, victory is checked and the game will be partially reset, offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions. The game ends when a single player is able to achieve a lead of four or more victory points  or after the fourth and final Dominance Check is resolved.&#10;&#10;",1,5,45,120,"['Action Points', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Auction: Dutch', 'Hand Management', 'Increase Value of Unchosen Resources', 'Negotiation', 'Open Drafting', 'Score-and-Reset Game', 'Simulation', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Tags', 'Take That']",13,120,3.8522,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Educational', 'Negotiation', 'Political', 'Post-Napoleonic', 'Spies / Secret Agents']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1962,14,63,168,0.0,0.1408194700206524,0.0,0.0,0.10063085380455086,0.0,0.0,0.1359980037124248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14989296800326296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23807600284279343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10643049330703692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29439405734878893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12839594592545872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08506625957210956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10703171219053136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278693636445986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1489730051725611,0.0,0.0,0.09912368663127887,0.14719702867439446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12583279493946709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278693636445986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1359980037124248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12296820590286696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09115056608989569,0.1415607867130683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09961949373103857,0.20936328102334423,0.0,0.12073501902877412,0.0,0.12437363860055169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23325209025684568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4224584100619572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10857753510489099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14633909121897348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11152826921772989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08627831724845705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4056294159959131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14387522926186816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1415607867130683

38,45,3076,Puerto Rico,2002,7.77185,"In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I &ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II &ndash; The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico, not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players.&#10;&#10;",3,5,90,150,"['Action Drafting', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Follow', 'Hidden Victory Points', 'Increase Value of Unchosen Resources', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Variable Phase Order']",12,150,3.2691,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['City Building', 'Economic', 'Farming']",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2756,22,113,215,0.07072869039330429,0.07594707547406238,0.0,0.1141622225824758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0668216990055874,0.07717057374074245,0.0,0.0,0.07405680432357321,0.0,0.05855828211957795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08084061495406476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14669350269184445,0.0,0.0,0.05740033467492647,0.48674333396496844,0.0,0.07892393007858295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08134902339748258,0.0,0.06582924203227182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07072869039330429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06924679232448704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0793866348499425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0723255753342439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09084719008035214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05978525335511302,0.0,0.08034445851684484,0.14669350269184445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06014967872360437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0564571394248441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06582924203227182,0.0,0.056304056966442834,0.0,0.14958444327115644,0.07405680432357321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07892393007858295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07334675134592222,0.0,0.0668216990055874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08134902339748258,0.0,0.07517002114926731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05306491224407997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051078843997773404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12335104901120436,0.0,0.12179694036161423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05229751301714437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06582924203227182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12839968900474458,0.0,0.0,0.5660912049505402,0.2410333755505345,0.0,0.10239503154375487,0.0,0.0,0.05838882029210899,0.0,0.055263211026535294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14739743421982704,0.0,0.0,0.07985997743905769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06465237911012275,0.0,0.0713526622596981,0.0,0.0,0.04937626326102481,0.07892393007858295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0793866348499425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06014967872360437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046531817446001406,0.061090001755532114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08134902339748258,0.10938248761560966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06924679232448704,0.0,0.0
39,46,521,Crokinole,1876,7.76954,"Crokinole is a traditional dexterity game. Crokinole is played on a circular wooden board, with wooden circular disks as playing pieces. It is usually played as a two-player game or as a four-player game with partners. Players take turns shooting disks across the circular wooden board by flicking the disks with their fingers.  Players try to land their disks in scoring regions on the board, with the highest scoring area the recessed hole in the very center of the board.  Each round, each player/side alternately shoots a set number of disks (usually 12 or 8), shooting one disk each turn.&#10;&#10;As a traditional game, there are often many variations played, but the following method is based on the National Crokinole Association's rules which also govern the World Crokinole Championship. Play is to a set score, usually the first player/side to 100.&#10;&#10;Players must position their disk on the start of each of their turns in their quadrant in front of them, touching the outer scoring ring boundary. If there are no opponent's disks on the board, they must aim for the center of the board. If there is an opponent's disk on the board, they must aim and hit an opponent's piece first, either directly, or by a carrom shot.&#10;&#10;The center recessed hole is worth 20 points, and disks are removed and scored at the end of the round if they land in the center hole. Disks that are outside the outer scoring ring at the end of each shot, or are touching the outer scoring ring at the end of each shot, are removed from play for the round. Scoring is by cancellation scoring (e.g. Player/Side One scores 250, and Player/Side Two scores 225, Player/Side One scores 25). Alternately, play is set at &quot;Match Scoring&quot; where the winner of each round scores 2 points, and if a tie, each player scores 1 point. A &quot;game&quot; is usually played to four rounds, with the winner of each &quot;game&quot; being the one with the most points. The numbers of &quot;games&quot; in a match is set by the tournament.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,30,"['Flicking', 'Team-Based Game']",8,30,1.2271,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Action / Dexterity'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2036,19,95,136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06687156928065113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0634328057855503,0.0,0.14194179625745665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11136874609397893,0.08269036932214872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05864719261234475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07533545850797391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1590482340609067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05120534050024301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052959424746590926,0.0,0.0,0.22101635400024064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07751832509688167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22385160359525708,0.05880664571230132,0.0,0.06782489703436984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21331255547261155,0.06573657729873655,0.0,0.06081871493060977,0.0,0.057563031086401505,0.40191042582205677,0.5919570038263082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21232650585076676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36520648862284927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057563031086401505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06641033982362693,0.0,0.12530570561820556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13663587626214213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05995730021678898,0.07952411703045335
40,47,295947,Cascadia,2021,7.76529,"Cascadia is a puzzly tile-laying and token-drafting game featuring the habitats and wildlife of the Pacific Northwest.&#10;&#10;In the game, you take turns building out your own terrain area and populating it with wildlife. You start with three hexagonal habitat tiles (with the five types of habitat in the game), and on a turn you choose a new habitat tile that's paired with a wildlife token, then place that tile next to your other ones and place the wildlife token on an appropriate habitat. (Each tile depicts 1-3 types of wildlife from the five types in the game, and you can place at most one tile on a habitat.) Four tiles are on display, with each tile being paired at random with a wildlife token, so you must make the best of what's available &mdash; unless you have a nature token to spend so that you can pick your choice of each item.&#10;&#10;Ideally you can place habitat tiles to create matching terrain that reduces fragmentation and creates wildlife corridors, mostly because you score for the largest area of each type of habitat at game's end, with a bonus if your group is larger than each other player's.

41,48,102794,Caverna: The Cave Farmers,2013,7.75816,"Following along the same lines as its predecessor (Agricola), Caverna: The Cave Farmers is a worker-placement game at heart, with a focus on farming. In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.&#10;&#10;It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.&#10;&#10;You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.&#10;&#10;Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.&#10;&#10;",1,7,30,210,"['Automatic Resource Growth', 'Increase Value of Unchosen Resources', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Tile Placement', 'Turn Order: Claim Action', 'Worker Placement']",12,210,3.7775,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Animals', 'Economic', 'Fantasy', 'Farming']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1912,15,61,179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1020274824116092,0.09700726438571605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11943792904138745,0.0,0.12178279326720495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13110088808035297,0.0,0.09800873893825982,0.0,0.12428729129400906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12642133364013047,0.0,0.0,0.1203580249344585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08200313145154291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08119069407019452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11168299076240379,0.14106960614103814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42078222060353104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11943792904138745,0.0,0.0,0.2837933007135642,0.0,0.0,0.23532799841085653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269747563814716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11396012434430138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23112091980379124,0.0,0.2908084957050332,0.0,0.14274270873919884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1454042478525166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0912989558139196,0.0,0.0,0.14026074020117701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13237004553103698,0.0,0.0,0.11168299076240379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12276423593023487,0.0,0.14274270873919884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10091218740098798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11475159396203449,0.0,0.11989510161337406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09108805598874486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2634599920567452,0.0,0.0,0.14274270873919884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10919302267674119,0.08562591501557115,0.0,0.12587611005639854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11638750411763958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10851148618499279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08455393868135766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
42,49,185343,Anachrony,2017,7.75234,"It is the late 26th century. Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital.&#10;&#10;By powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...&#10;&#10;Anachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them &mdash; and both are in short supply.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs &mdash; unless, of course, it is averted! The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past &quot;self&quot; with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of victory points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet...&#10;&#10;",1,4,30,120,"['Contracts', 'Dice Rolling', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Turn Order: Claim Action', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Worker Placement', 'Worker Placement, Different Worker Types']",15,120,4.0066,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Science Fiction']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,2227,21,83,206,0.0,0.13041324831102857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11699622196613613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21971830658438066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.272639041296549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11303931367592207,0.0,0.11101845223344708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11562745296654041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1189077929042803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15756013328044677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2145867675807173,0.13552498271688804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12973979080619277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18359736698701803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13474790857938487,0.0,0.0,0.1138811498752293,0.0,0.0,0.12973979080619277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13474790857938487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08771052636512537,0.17706556638496224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12716735109398422,0.0,0.0,0.10729338379035865,0.10457239154868743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09225785163556956,0.0,0.0,0.11181299016483354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26502838016437086,0.22048275619188784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12092865434675529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11842012379332621,0.0,0.0,0.1396892549446328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13041324831102857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4113022985617874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30985979137099295,0.0,0.0,0.10026292219696353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10800765959874449,0.0,0.0,0.09391359330988526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09884283371713173,0.0

These &ldquo;Gods&rsquo; Gifts&rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.&#10;&#10;Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents&rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent&rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,90,"['Action Points', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Closed Drafting', 'Hand Management', 'Map Reduction', 'Memory', 'Open Drafting', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Take That']",14,90,2.8808,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Mythology']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2094,15,97,187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12470989354078166,0.0592867986559696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0808990572734435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08672132126321233,0.0,0.0,0.5662934009141044,0.0,0.0877676401314696,0.0,0.06825599122453052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08886501872558933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06305787271534362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07726345238991401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07564463886106056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07974537877612774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06652499891159896,0.0,0.04962036979971598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20476797367359156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0877676401314696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05658738519814081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07760168131375074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08253554608775117,0.08886501872558933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08340072196683272,0.0,0.07244687875359546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08384611869119492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05370147479465099,0.0,0.11159623653168668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07726345238991401,0.1476886686439761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05554106632988354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0877676401314696,0.05869095455070675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07327489125892493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0689410736147331,0.5861991300713995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08050788568196933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07660188117889719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17773003745117866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1500567732496843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05393823276588202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06871038646854985,0.0,0.0,0.05974427475741214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0716482694329672,0.07974537877612774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06288007100220212,0.0
44,53,31260,Agricola,2007,7.74414,"Description originally from BoardgameNews&#10;&#10;In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. At first, on a turn, your family gets to take only two actions, one for you and one for your spouse, as might be found among all the possibilities on a farm: plowing fields; collecting materials; building fences, and so on. There are numerous choices available, and while the game progresses you'll have more and more, as each round a new action card is flipped over, offering one more possible action. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished but first you'll need to expand your house to make room--and what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&#10;&#10;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the distribution of cards which represent Minor Improvements or Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release) these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist. Each player starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit into his/her strategy.&#10;&#10;Agricola is a turn-based game, and the problem to be overcome is that each available action can be taken by only one player each round so it's important to be careful about your choices.  There are countless strategies, some of which depend on your hand of cards.  Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions...&#10;&#10;",1,5,30,150,"['Automatic Resource Growth', 'Closed Drafting', 'Enclosure', 'Hand Management', 'Increase Value of Unchosen Resources', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Turn Order: Claim Action', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Worker Placement']",12,150,3.6357,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Animals', 'Economic', 'Farming']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1875,18,92,183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2879474839604014,0.1825194352573775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21820099561220865,0.0,0.0,0.1079527201259703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12770581372256198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09651927216226194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1334894693301285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11643921647116,0.0,0.43245872963145904,0.0,0.10684177596218439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1342853999190969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26390096919453093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08710453105243172,0.1257639147323288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12639918862560903,0.0,0.0,0.173798123737953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10871366187336032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27357849301410514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08922921331659399,0.0,0.08266227114812404,0.0,0.08588961847479204,0.0,0.24103407326711418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10506592743795773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11366802140571583,0.08793882336919773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10145283178062736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17217833264571872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1189310438068529,0.0,0.11549062409747349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0830267108900346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26241181692777255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12392517526293335,0.0,0.07824374505323475,0.10272348653066135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10576537457629377,0.11502589959240676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11643921647116,0.0,0.0

In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.&#10;&#10;However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.&#10;&#10;Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#152;&#155; Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!

49,65,182874,Grand Austria Hotel,2015,7.69597,"In the thick of the Viennese modern age, exquisite caf&eacute;s are competing for customers. Inspiring artists, important politicians, and tourists from all over the world are populating Vienna and in need of a hotel room. This is your opportunity to turn your little caf&eacute; into a world famous hotel. Hire staff, fulfill the wishes of your guests, and gain the emperor's favor. Only then will your caf&eacute; become the Grand Austria Hotel.&#10;&#10;The start player rolls the dice, sorting them by the rolled number and placing them on the corresponding action spaces. On a turn, a player chooses one of the six actions and carries it out. The number of the available dice in the corresponding action spaces determines how much the player gets from the action. They then remove one of the dice and can carry out additional actions. With the different actions, a player can get the necessary drinks and dishes, prepare the rooms, or hire staff.&#10;&#10;But no hotel can grow without guests. To choose wisely which guests to attract and to complete their orders brings some important bonus actions. The staff cards also have different advantages, but the game ends after seven rounds and no player can do everything they want, so whoever makes the right decisions and finds the best way to create bonus actions will win.&#10;&#10;With 116 different cards and a new set-up in each game, Grand Austria Hotel provides a huge replay value.

At this time, Scotland made the transition from an agricultural to an industrialized country that heavily relied on trade and export. In the following years, food production increased significantly to feed the population growth. Linen was increasingly substituted by the cheaper cotton and raising sheep was given high importance. More and more distilleries were founded and whisky became the premium alcoholic beverage in Europe.&#10;&#10;Players represent historic clans with unique abilities and compete to produce, trade and export agricultural goods and of course whisky!&#10;&#10;The game ends after five rounds. Each round consists of the three phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Players' turns&#10;     Production phase&#10;     Round scoring&#10;&#10;&#10;1. Players take turns and do one of eight possible actions, from building, to upgrading, trading and exporting. When players run out of money, they pass and collect a passing bonus.&#10;&#10;2. In the production phase, each player collects basic resources, refined goods and cash from their production units built on the game map. Each production unit built makes income visible on the player mat. Refined goods require the respective basic resource.&#10;&#10;3.

54,70,266810,Paladins of the West Kingdom,2019,7.67527,"Paladins of the West Kingdom is set at a turbulent time of West Francia's story, circa 900 AD. Despite recent efforts to develop the city, outlying townships are still under threat from outsiders. Saracens scout the borders, while Vikings plunder wealth and livestock. Even the Byzantines from the east have shown their darker side. As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom, the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching.&#10;&#10;The aim of Paladins of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications, commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round, players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses, players will slowly increase their faith, strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score, but they will also determine the significance of their actions. The game is concluded at the end of the seventh round.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",1,4,90,120,"['End Game Bonuses', 'Market', 'Open Drafting', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Worker Placement', 'Worker Placement, Different Worker Types']",12,120,3.7157,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Medieval'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,1313,15,50,135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14448146138567003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14597304562741048,0.15280833489562481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35049471120197506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16915081844614463,0.21133917690702445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24184890079027604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1663393130344821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21388904774822878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18066532694245477,0.0,0.0,0.33946169720835384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21656335073921693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20324690257456907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13725433775154522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16579391213217032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2725909937703025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14711898991138084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13566546306991242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18667818112159312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21656335073921693,0.0,0.0,0.21520989090095072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21010738712635263,0.0,0.0,0.12753021551813334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1455963270418338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

56,72,164153,Star Wars: Imperial Assault,2014,7.66691,"Star Wars: Imperial Assault is a strategy board game of tactical combat and missions for two to five players, offering two distinct games of battle and adventure in the Star Wars universe!&#10;&#10;Imperial Assault puts you in the midst of the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire after the destruction of the Death Star over Yavin 4. In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.&#10;&#10;In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.&#10;&#10;Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You&rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you&rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.&#10;&#10;As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault.&#10;&#10;With these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes, imperial and mercenary groups, and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list), and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault &#226;&#128;&#147; Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode.&#10;&#10;",2,5,60,120,"['Dice Rolling', 'Die Icon Resolution', 'Grid Movement', 'Line of Sight', 'Modular Board', 'Role Playing', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Square Grid', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers']",14,120,3.3033,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Science Fiction', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2580,16,97,200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1048165431752983,0.0,0.33443915465547636,0.11995647147834528,0.10156229198061036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45023571060249507,0.10005385675070635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08334029433187608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21689780493032323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2385373283689848,0.0,0.0,0.11483585685423736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10524819101340384,0.0,0.07817898532997974,0.122869640581427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06973016065039121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09496799390375046,0.0,0.09086759911445891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.245739281162854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2031245839612207,0.08580919916712376,0.08125325631837585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2001077135014127,0.0,0.17115305831540248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11995647147834528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09757733564832755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4078041678998956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10703690482192979,0.0,0.1549107860882184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10439076827933431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10439076827933431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11793680479788302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12211553247440661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Ours is a brave new age, and as humanity hurtles into space and the future with an astonishing series of new advances every day, NBN and our affiliates are keeping pace, bringing you all the vid that's fit to view.&#10;&#10;Android: Netrunner is an asymmetrical Living Card Game for two players. Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.&#10;&#10;Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with &quot;ice&quot;. These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.&#10;&#10;In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result.

The promo homeworlds and first edition compatible Revised Cards are both available for purchase through the BGG store.&#10;&#10;In the card game Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by playing game cards in front of them that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Some worlds allow players to produce goods, which can be consumed later to gain either card draws or victory points when the appropriate technologies are available to them. These are mainly provided by the developments and worlds that are not able to produce, but the fancier production worlds also give these bonuses.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, players each select, secretly and simultaneously, one of the seven roles which correspond to the phases in which the round progresses. By selecting a role, players activate that phase for this round, giving each player the opportunity to perform that phase's action. For example, if one player chooses the settle role, each player has the opportunity to settle one of the planets from their hand. The player who has chosen the role, however, gets a bonus that applies only to them. But bonuses may also be acquired through developments, so you must be aware when another player also takes advantage of your choice of role.&#10;&#10;UPC 655132003018&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,60,"['Follow', 'Hand Management', 'Multi-Use Cards', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Tags']",12,60,2.9918,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Civilization', 'Economic', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1492,10,51,136,0.0,0.15019541877615525,0.0,0.11288547137702203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13214877601055253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11580677268825192,0.0,0.0,0.2566272353469189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15889182720936001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450529327891453,0.0,0.10843904438882893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16087848755136006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13927212240224418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2439430662348966,0.0,0.12043480508683076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15889182720936001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1569976038193726,0.0,0.0,0.1301860606618179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14791154207894633,0.14645715676572185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10220240260181718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1363830769880353,0.0,0.1278586580813897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1486586907455377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10101519139427001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13987536987832272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11165148421961578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14717785628563826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4975646531179607,0.15889182720936001,0.0,0.30374964172052127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13809179454521198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14717785628563826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11513924200271194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1352825110759486,0.0,0.10815919132932836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
63,80,157354,Five Tribes: The Djinns of Naqala,2014,7.62215,"Crossing into the Land of 1001 Nights, your caravan arrives at the fabled Sultanate of Naqala. The old sultan just died and control of Naqala is up for grabs! The oracles foretold of strangers who would maneuver the Five Tribes to gain influence over the legendary city-state. Will you fulfill the prophecy? Invoke the old Djinns and move the Tribes into position at the right time, and the Sultanate may become yours!&#10;&#10;Designed by Bruno Cathala, Five Tribes builds on a long tradition of German-style games that feature wooden meeples. Here, in a unique twist on the now-standard &quot;worker placement&quot; genre, the game begins with the meeples already in place &ndash; and players must cleverly maneuver them over the villages, markets, oases, and sacred places tiles that make up Naqala.

Sneak into an angry dragon's mountain lair to steal precious artifacts. Delve deeper to find more valuable loot. Acquire cards for your deck and watch your thievish abilities grow.&#10;&#10;Be quick and be quiet. One false step and CLANK! Each careless sound draws the attention of the dragon, and each artifact stolen increases its rage. You can enjoy your plunder only if you make it out of the depths alive!&#10;&#10;Clank! is a deck-building game. Each player has their own deck, and building yours up is part of playing the game. You start each of your turns with five cards in your hand, and you'll play them all in any order you choose. Most cards will generate resources, of which there are three different kinds:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Skill, which is used to acquire new cards for your deck.&#10;    Swords, which are used to fight the monsters that infest the dungeon.&#10;    Boots, which are used to move around the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;Every time you acquire a new card, you put it face up in your discard pile. Whenever you need to draw a card and find your deck empty, you shuffle your discard pile and turn it face down to form a new deck. With each shuffle, your newest cards become part of a bigger and better deck! Each player starts with the same cards in their deck, but they&rsquo;ll acquire different cards during their turns. Because cards can do many different things, each player&rsquo;s deck (and strategy) will become more and more different as the game unfolds.&#10;&#10;During the game, you have two goals:&#10;&#10;    Retrieve an Artifact token and escape the dragon by returning to the place you started, outside of the dungeon.&#10;    Accumulate enough points with your Artifact and other loot to beat out your opponents and earn the title of Greatest Thief in the Realm!&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,60,"['Action Points', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Delayed Purchase', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Movement Points', 'Open Drafting', 'Player Elimination', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Push Your Luck', 'Variable Set-up']",12,60,2.2268,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Fantasy']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1885,22,108,164,0.08541463756173326,0.0,0.3612876453906183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09531151849586512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07570680006763406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1589957573901979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09171655645563523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2079564355674189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06971038928229516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6211718062757009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22161663859041306,0.18538353173308034,0.07263902355694875,0.0,0.08734309612217989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07979213837429469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07219892971956962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1452780471138975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1613928144316892,0.06817977365238778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06240970932742771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06408319200269477,0.0,0.05936690458727731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09219938041642343,0.07176649007732326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07545690195719468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816348073636357,0.06315645171569996,0.0,0.0,0.1658875510263649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06140057043294216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06817977365238778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09587029825163314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07753015670439843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16201057772234645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0667379406303266,0.08541463756173326,0.0,0.08294377551318245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05962864019029561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05785183786912023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1452780471138975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22132377948376647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07354329239849865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

70,89,25613,Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization,2006,7.58572,"Through the Ages is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&#10;&#10;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.&#10;&#10;",2,4,120,120,"['Action Points', 'Auction / Bidding', 'Auction: Dutch', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting']",12,120,4.1772,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Civilization', 'Economic']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1370,13,44,126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12680001944649938,0.1547591706640041,0.0,0.12035461565259033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31685587997738823,0.33169287667545094,0.13393757699428963,0.1520229545382342,0.0,0.0,0.1547591706640041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1362373170406518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.139313230347776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08749474483696203,0.0,0.3818081009309532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1566941594693999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2812273103206144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14705905895421623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24070923130518065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13020844494380698,0.10073525781029882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09793460722120129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37098444156651206,0.0,0.12920435578238018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11214455718822582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1520229545382342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17925879669528727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10534605236656351,0.0,0.0,0.11730238667191159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10845264654212175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
71,90,93,El Grande,1995,7.57934,"In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had there into the region you secretly indicated on your region dial.

72,91,62219,Dominant Species,2010,7.57631,"90,000 B.C. &mdash; A great ice age is fast approaching. Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species. &#10;Dominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. &#10;Each player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes&mdash;mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid, or insect. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won&rsquo;t last: It is indeed &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;.&#10;Through wily action pawn placement, players will strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration, and adaptation actions, among others. &#10;All of this eventually leads to the end game&mdash;the final ascent of the ice age&mdash;where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. &#10;But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it&rsquo;s getting mighty cold...&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles&mdash;converting them into tundra in the process&mdash;as the ice age encroaches.&#10;The cylindrical action pawns (or &quot;AP&quot;s) drive the game. Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration, or glaciation.

The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.&#10;Throughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the &quot;earth&quot;).

This time Trzewiczek takes the players to a deserted island, where they'll play the parts of shipwreck survivors confronted by an extraordinary adventure. They'll be faced with the challenges of building a shelter, finding food, fighting wild beasts, and protecting themselves from weather changes. Building walls around their homes, animal domestication, constructing weapons and tools from what they find, and much more await them on the island. The players decide in which direction the game will unfold and &ndash; after several in-game weeks of hard work &ndash; how their settlement will look. Will they manage to discover the secret of the island in the meantime? Will they find a pirate treasure, or an abandoned village? Will they discover an underground city or a cursed temple at the bottom of a volcano? Answers to these questions lie in hundreds of event cards and hundreds of object and structure cards that can be used during the game...&#10;&#10;Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is an epic game from Portal.

Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.&#10;&#10;7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.&#10;&#10;In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how her choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.&#10;&#10;Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.&#10;&#10;",2,7,30,30,"['Closed Drafting', 'Hand Management', 'Neighbor Scope', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Variable Player Powers']",10,30,2.3172,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Ancient', 'Card Game', 'City Building', 'Civilization', 'Economic']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1614,16,64,157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15811978030430973,0.0,0.0,0.11594321712413834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14453866898623088,0.10856680811020926,0.0,0.0,0.15626644140115714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11429252868640649,0.0,0.1503723801810189,0.1303394468860856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20368641523562303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11429252868640649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14662971372135192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13436903914709158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15626644140115714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13230447472123485,0.16106803583053797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1488338415655419,0.0,0.2991917063699862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14190766357999654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12211524092178555,0.12371412956261277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28772965655589466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1063774802061633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14735126237502066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38133990143057067,0.16106803583053797,0.13281089657130465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14735126237502066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1258051742977338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11594321712413834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2932894855262982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1488338415655419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12453772191081149,0.0,0.0,0.10828662532566802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15363543599492277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11397026270240396,0.0

After a long and grueling journey that led through Jerusalem and Mesopotamia and over the &quot;Silk Road&quot;, they reached the court of Kublai Khan in 1275.&#10;&#10;In The Voyages of Marco Polo, players recreate this journey, with each player having a different character from history with a special power in the game. The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and take turns performing actions by placing their dice onto the board. Players may choose from a variety of actions, each require the use of one or more dice: collecting resources or money, acquiring contracts, traveling on the map or using a special action granted by a city. When traveling, each player begins at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a player stops at a city, they place a trading post there, giving them access to extra actions or resources for the rest of the game. The higher the value of the dice used for an action, the better the options that may be chosen, but also the more money the player must pay if an opponent has already chosen the same action.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the game ends with players receiving extra victory points for having trading posts in Beijing, fulfilling the most contracts, and having trading posts in the cities on secret goal cards that each player gets at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;This game should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which has the same German title.&#10;&#10;",2,4,40,100,"['Contracts', 'Dice Rolling', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Resource to Move', 'Turn Order: Claim Action', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up', 'Worker Placement with Dice Workers']",12,100,3.1798,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Dice', 'Economic', 'Medieval', 'Travel']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1610,11,60,151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26036754113628136,0.24755626918803708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12142338910745842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12291440293411449,0.0,0.11547400328152911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11152033113508228,0.0,0.08776755290234003,0.24737482875053562,0.11547400328152911,0.20018061427661518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36250916708433634,0.0,0.06975556388286766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08776755290234003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24432004019945075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25752138035005806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.113718101621032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09830094168761866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11152033113508228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11608189369725168,0.15532602309169874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21602091465283063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1207036936702399,0.12000017254117944,0.10753969097024678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07730523196311836,0.0,0.0,0.11152033113508228,0.0,0.08168942649986634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10198818352170703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19522576764058394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10400858598223534,0.07784344647039092,0.19191225663256137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11205547874323472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10848841123232122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17807030012488664,0.0,0.08402514740156632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09145479473642844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07074946871772769,0.09288451226270245,0.09628053922709036,0.1061684335407813,0.12142338910745842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08315549779254133,0.0,0.0,0.09259329739300197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Since then, astronomers have been scanning the sky, hoping to find this planet.&#10;&#10;In The Search for Planet X, players take on the role of astronomers who use observations and logical deductions to search for this hypothetical planet. Each game, the companion app randomly selects an arrangement of objects and a location for Planet X following predefined logic rules.&#10;&#10;Each round, as the earth travels around the sun, players use the app to perform scans and attend conferences. As they gain information about the location of the objects, they mark that information on their deduction sheets. As players learn the locations of the various objects, they can start publishing theories, which is how players score points.&#10;&#10;As more and more objects are found, players narrow down the possible locations for Planet X. Once a player believes they know its location and the objects on either side of it, they use the app to conduct a search. The game ends when a player successfully locates Planet X, and all players have a final chance to score some additional points.&#10;&#10;The Search for Planet X captures the thrill of discovery, the puzzle-y nature of astronomical investigation, and the competition inherent in the scientific process.

78,102,291453,SCOUT,2019,7.54286,"SCOUT is a ladder-climbing game in which cards have two potential values, players may not rearrange their hand of cards, and players may pass their turn to take a card from the current high set of cards into their hand.&#10;&#10;More specifically, cards are dual-indexed, with different values on each half of the card, with the 45 cards having all possible combinations of the numbers 1-10. During set-up, whoever is shuffling the cards should randomize both the order of the cards in the deck and their orientation. Once each player has been dealt their entire hand of cards, they pick up that hand without rearranging any of the cards; if they wish, they can rotate their entire hand of cards in order to use the values on the other end of each card, but again they cannot rearrange the order of cards in their hand.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player takes one of two actions:&#10;&#10;&bull; Play: A player chooses one or more adjacent cards in their hand that have all the same value or that have values in consecutive order (whether ascending or descending), then they play this set of cards to the table. They can do this only if the table is empty (as on the first turn) or the set they're playing is ranked higher than the set currently on the table; a set is higher if it has more cards or has cards of the same value instead of consecutive cards or has a set of the same quantity and type but with higher values. In this latter case when a player overplays another set, the player captures the cards in this previous set and places them face down in front of themselves.&#10;&#10;&bull; Scout: A player takes a card from either end of the set currently on the table and places it anywhere they wish in their hand in either orientation. Whoever played this previous set receives a 1 VP token as a reward for playing a set that wasn't beaten.&#10;&#10;Once per round, a player can scout, then immediately play.&#10;&#10;When a player has emptied their hand of cards or all but one player have scouted instead of playing, the round ends. Players receive 1 VP for each face-down card, then subtract one point for each card in their hand (except if they were the player scouted repeatedly to end the game).

79,103,155821,Inis,2016,7.53933,"Inis is a game deeply rooted in Celtic history and lore in which players win by being elected King of the Island (Inis). Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.&#10;     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.&#10;     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.&#10;&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,90,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Closed Drafting', 'Hand Management', 'Interrupts', 'King of the Hill', 'Map Addition', 'Modular Board', 'Take That', 'Variable Set-up']",14,90,2.9476,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Exploration', 'Medieval', 'Mythology', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2806,27,140,224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2417856172304497,0.15325910719305666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09434834847567368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20912779187883335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08104593057529745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11486008470122332,0.09128539508630541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09507516556507936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19554487809437515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19433173576558788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10211950140280406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06413547152565013,0.0,0.09329109853454505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15096371679703577,0.0,0.11275763850376853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10456389593941667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21227138656626526,0.0,0.0,0.21890390937008794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10779735520941404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31369168781825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08625552567181084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06941039378544638,0.10779735520941404,0.0,0.1455929159383656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10955978385464653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08598509423972861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09544550394031046,0.0,0.0,0.10259221375815038,0.0,0.10211950140280406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07585941135855107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1894189713156386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0947094856578193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07228791142724447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10030196151962424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07195375637683565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35885439097035776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08268088494865689,0.0,0.07802843641225388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13943281783925426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11017183107800754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09002123203460352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08625552567181084,0.0,0.0,0.11275763850376853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3088834080028607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07949805027884645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10356134247596756,0.0,0.0,0.0
80,104,37111,Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game,2008,7.53793,"Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is an exciting game of mistrust, intrigue, and the struggle for survival. Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.&#10;&#10;After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival&hellip;but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?&#10;&#10;Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game for 3-6 players ages 10 and up that can be played in 2-3 hours. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost.&#10;&#10;Official Site, Rules &amp; FAQ: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=18&amp;esem=4&#10;Unofficial FAQ for really tricky questions: http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ&#10;&#10;",3,6,120,180,"['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Hidden Roles', 'Once-Per-Game Abilities', 'Role Playing', 'Semi-Cooperative Game', 'Team-Based Game', 'Traitor Game', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up', 'Voting']",14,180,3.2492,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Bluffing', 'Deduction', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Political', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration', 'Spies / Secret Agents']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2608,24,110,222,0.23546688596652285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09034075896579886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11341367105239461,0.0,0.0,0.2597694066872368,0.09747484550874325,0.0,0.13456553314505013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21373133562133192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12209141042444745,0.23754418601963367,0.09608709205112867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10761894709723657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12776405828308798,0.2583262869485398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13214526941988322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10137027176568006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10998352790542358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995172351980997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10012384975726014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08622741390296523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1147939714648864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33368984974153054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12209141042444745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08833070123820075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17004947027923656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09892117099391319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20801588856125927,0.10137027176568006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0870533051401334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08943281638979465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12387996375971849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1354118188058264,0.11165570480336805,0.10470034819087216,0.0,0.0,0.08522227359922366,0.0,0.0,0.09719276302861796,0.1291631434742699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10878084914207663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11672534595882941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09198994168115512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13456553314505013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23445137619676898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10470034819087216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09372251124294166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12209141042444745,0.23053341523994997,0.0,0.0

82,109,122515,Keyflower,2012,7.52153,"Keyflower is a game for two to six players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a &quot;home&quot; tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.&#10;&#10;In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.&#10;&#10;Keyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.&#10;&#10;Keyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the &quot;Key&quot; series from R&amp;D Games set in the medieval &quot;Key&quot; land.&#10;&#10;",2,6,90,120,"['Auction / Bidding', 'Auction: Fixed Placement', 'Auction: Multiple Lot', 'Constrained Bidding', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Modular Board', 'Network and Route Building', 'Ownership', 'Selection Order Bid', 'Set Collection', 'Tile Placement', 'Turn Order: Auction', 'Variable Set-up', 'Worker Placement', 'Worker Placement, Different Worker Types']",12,120,3.3356,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['City Building', 'Economic', 'Renaissance', 'Territory Building', 'Transportation']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,1751,13,74,142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10757384726407639,0.0,0.11441230379656828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12171542687413811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253279037928527,0.0,0.09746622204561857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10892161947726157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11972816269177992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14312896465130626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11846850354173748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08339070455971405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08782770541864068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11909215792126426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07668308338377139,0.0,0.07967698786669812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09746622204561857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08380781680381841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1238338115481351,0.0,0.4005768205468709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07986210187409067,0.0984444862414073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10193892851285949,0.15898586938077192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09911361859750135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1103284366917233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10713687193327667,0.0,0.0,0.12311204653608655,0.21089220614090592,0.6670525139928764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19058643256939325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09811507626274323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07379058266698091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
83,110,170042,Raiders of the North Sea,2015,7.51997,"Raiders of the North Sea is set in the central years of the Viking Age. As Viking warriors, players seek to impress the Chieftain by raiding unsuspecting settlements. To do so, players need to assemble a crew, collect provisions, and journey north to plunder gold, iron and livestock. Glory can be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie, so gather your warriors because it's raiding season!&#10;&#10;To impress the Chieftain, you need victory points (VPs), with those being acquired primarily by raiding settlements, taking plunder, and making offerings to the Chieftain. How you use your plunder is also vital to your success. Players take turns in clockwise order, and on a turn you place a worker and resolve its action, then pick up a different worker and resolve its action. Broadly speaking, those actions fall in one of two categories:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Work: Having a good crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding, so before making any raids, players need to do some work to prepare their crew and collect supplies. This is all done in the village at the bottom of the game board, with eight buildings offering various actions. You must first place your worker in an available building where no other worker is present, then pick up a different worker from a different building.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Raid: Once players have hired enough crew and collected provisions, you may choose to raid on your turn. To raid a settlement &mdash; whether a harbor, outpost, monastery or fortress &mdash; you need to meet three requirements: Having a large enough crew, having enough provisions (along with gold for monasteries and fortresses, and having a worker of the right color. Raiding offers various ways of scoring, such as military strength, plunder, and Valkyries, which is how grey and white workers enter the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when only one fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie have been removed, or all offerings have been made, then players tally their scores.&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,80,"['Contracts', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Worker Placement', 'Worker Placement, Different Worker Types']",12,80,2.5598,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Medieval', 'Nautical']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,2027,14,98,172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17572422664029325,0.16707779227463104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10487462132329986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09987029755928609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11399195261646076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17670695596975505,0.10703139795092845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08885258099320123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19903237800707138,0.10839962708730039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21185375522063826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11690155290757452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08885258099320123,0.40681095087921826,0.0,0.09617706286931445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23887659459560537,0.11570547186436025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12521650245674235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12078711302711924,0.0,0.24296735404659986,0.0,0.0,0.07862312204638809,0.15872037499974498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3847082514772578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08049895860698708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1565218388131236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1032490144369781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11878482288817402,0.10934573871948695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07844150329131633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10982960133991086,0.0,0.0,0.0760024242665979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09258540642664366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07162411040971672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19363466973681956,0.0,0.0,0.0841835092618237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11943829729780268,0.0,0.1236702257395688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21317628114239867,0.0,0.0
84,111,42,Tigris & Euphrates,1997,7.51606,"Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris &amp; Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.&#10;&#10;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile.

Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.&#10;&#10;The players embody master builders.

Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.&#10;&#10;As new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game.

89,118,146021,Eldritch Horror,2013,7.50893,"Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring. Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?&#10;&#10;Eldritch Horror is a co-operative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.&#10;&#10;While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.&#10;&#10;Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.&#10;&#10;All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements.

90,119,172386,Mombasa,2015,7.5056,"In Mombasa, players acquire shares of chartered companies based in Mombasa, Cape Town, Saint-Louis, and Cairo and spread their trading posts throughout the African continent in order to earn the most money.&#10;&#10;&quot;As I expected, the East African Company's network of trading posts has spread far into the West. They were even able to expand into a couple of diamond mines. It seems reasonable to invest our recent yield here in Mombasa, rather than to continue our unrivalled commitment in Cape Town. After all, it can only be to our advantage to have other irons in the fire. And when the day of reckoning comes, it will show whether our hoarding of holdings and our intransigent eagerness are worth it...&quot;&#10;&#10;Mombasa is a tense Euro-style strategy game set in 18th century Africa in which players invest in four chartered companies. Using influence to help them expand across the continent improves the value of the players' shares in these companies. Players will also trade in bananas, coffee or cotton, work together with diamond merchants and ensure that the accounts are kept up to date. To make the most of this one will need to have the correct action cards (back) in hand at the same time, which needs excellent forward planning.&#10;&#10;Mombasa features a unique, rotating-display hand-mechanism that drives game play: Players start with an identical hand, but acquire new and more powerful cards from the rotating display throughout the game. Each round players choose action cards from their hand, place them face down in the so-called action slot (beneath the player board), and then reveal them simultaneously to carry out the actions. At the end of the action phase, each card is moved to the so-called resting slot (above the player board). Cards in the resting slots are inactive and cannot be used until they are recovered - each round one can only return cards of one resting slot which is why it can make quite a difference in which action slots certain cards are placed.&#10;&#10;The game ends after seven rounds, players add up their scores in different categories, and the player with the highest score (who has earned the most money) wins the game. With a variety of paths to victory and double-sided company boards, each game will be a new and different challenge.&#10;&#10;",2,4,75,150,"['Action Queue', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Investment', 'Open Drafting', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Stock Holding', 'Turn Order: Claim Action', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Victory Points as a Resource', 'Worker Placement']",12,150,3.8912,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Economic'],False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2320,18,90,208,0.0,0.11480491083136114,0.22611836682729,0.43143148376948565,0.08204061694182534,0.10424716759073216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09671080554361258,0.09704728427626258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24000859752031145,0.12145218677933882,0.0,0.10555326046883794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0872590002814224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11480491083136114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13870275670688417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1093304933105757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06866428688236008,0.0872590002814224,0.0,0.0,0.09445211677781254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09092487708439538,0.0,0.0,0.11421205519903314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08081187923311169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31248190691992683,0.09637792558296562,0.0,0.1093304933105757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16043047030918783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21476922198638518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09445211677781254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07905520102200266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07685730129824914,0.09951035262960349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10645546797611422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12297073085527654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15478479444504667,0.0954001285312274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08353827944728251,0.11665440415986333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07703464639137392,0.0,0.11249837581534865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08353827944728251,0.0,0.0,0.10382370555324394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2386097081046072,0.0,0.0,0.07241522517482865,0.0,0.10645546797611422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12145218677933882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0882630867000702,0.0,0.09234631038066507,0.09572265970387085,0.10555326046883794,0.12071982405717144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08267366885977886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12145218677933882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07150863740160554,0.0,0.10467647066786101,0.0,0.11540927894010437

In a land fraught with danger and wonders, you have to use every ounce of wit and cunning to survive, crafting tools, weapons, and shelter to ensure your survival.&#10;&#10;Unlike most board games, it will take you many, MANY hours of exploring and searching the seventh continent until you eventually discover how to remove the curse(s)...or die trying.&#10;&#10;The 7th Continent features an easy saving system so that you can stop playing at any time and resume your adventure later on, just like in a video game!&#10;&#10;",1,4,5,1000,"['Area Movement', 'Cooperative Game', 'Hand Management', 'Map Addition', 'Modular Board', 'Narrative Choice / Paragraph', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Storytelling', 'Variable Player Powers']",14,1000,2.8979,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Card Game', 'Exploration', 'Science Fiction']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1086,10,54,116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.541217175506463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18478691759724064,0.0,0.0,0.1462403449075707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16765731068084533,0.0,0.2638957710199287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1754470551117827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16686630321642476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1366581970156814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17270469676087036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12870081630329402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34903013500645175,0.0,0.0,0.17182497327346302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1396406141495735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2247394573523787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1290507349134166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14937909683683506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1836527943754913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17360117788999244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15699605048622467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10950200907333642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15699605048622467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10636325714407203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18254535889829526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
93,124,12493,Twilight Imperium: Third Edition,2005,7.49276,"Twilight Imperium Third Edition is an epic empire-building game of interstellar conflict, trade, and struggle for power. Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer (Christian T. Petersen) has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.&#10;&#10;TI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races, each with their own advantages and quirks. The 'designer notes' in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from Puerto Rico to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map, basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of CATAN, while the &quot;Command&quot; system cleverly improves on the 'oil' logistical mechanism of Attack! to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies, uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right.&#10;&#10;Part of the Twilight Imperium Series.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Second Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition &#226;&#128;&#147; Shattered Empire&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition &#226;&#128;&#147; Shards of the Throne&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented in:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;",3,6,180,240,"['Action Points', 'Area-Impulse', 'Dice Rolling', 'Follow', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Increase Value of Unchosen Resources', 'Modular Board', 'Player Elimination', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks', 'Tile Placement', 'Trading', 'Variable Phase Order', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Voting']",14,240,4.2581,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Civilization', 'Negotiation', 'Political', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1974,10,134,180,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14504343323867203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12024635819235921,0.12066472242769895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14274384700315917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1078849256488634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5796010958232333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15194133942109883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14128335990791122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10582445266137876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13919104955551997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15289690191786845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14833889691872118,0.0,0.1434952942036605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3988074049151641,0.0,0.12909025435822108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15100880478270656,0.1009808499463181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11339943793939118,0.12607327407935595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12607327407935595,0.0,0.15100880478270656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13124071395500403,0.0,0.0,0.12282720200123991,0.09578180670847156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14274384700315917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15194133942109883,0.09280354410653427,0.0,0.0,0.11481971898960812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15100880478270656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102793142326856,0.0,0.0,0.1144597320693987,0.0,0.11410306304818062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
94,126,163412,Patchwork,2014,7.48594,"In Patchwork, two players compete to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 9x9 game board. To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons &mdash; the currency/points in the game &mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.&#10;&#10;In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &quot;button income&quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.&#10;&#10;What's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn't happen in every game.)&#10;&#10;When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board. Scores can be negative.

95,127,144733,Russian Railroads,2013,7.48419,"In Russian Railroads, players compete in an exciting race to build the largest and most advanced railway network. In order to do so, the players appoint their workers to various important tasks.&#10;&#10;The development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places, while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery. Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.&#10;&#10;There are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:&#10;- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.&#10;- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.&#10;- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.&#10;&#10;The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:&#10;- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces&#10;- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.&#10;- earn 2 coins&#10;- take 2 temporary workers&#10;- jump ahead in turn order&#10;- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you&#10;&#10;Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.&#10;&#10;After 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!&#10;&#10;",2,4,120,120,"['End Game Bonuses', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks', 'Turn Order: Claim Action', 'Worker Placement']",13,120,3.4049,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Industry / Manufacturing', 'Trains']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2896,28,183,235,0.04491758004633217,0.0,0.09499640339663735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04062995335205111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10267869440256666,0.04658022870773768,0.0,0.034822567123290585,0.0,0.0,0.10024424111807041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048231613266431585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0894477235222649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04798254392458721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08740729388703455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045931711748199905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07331815904236284,0.0,0.050122120559035206,0.0,0.0,0.03796774531290854,0.0,0.051024253759563966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051024253759563966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05071657497360842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07151389264130531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0954762607162973,0.0,0.0,0.051024253759563966,0.0,0.0,0.2535828748680421,0.0,0.15036636167710563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062439360864224254,0.0,0.03243857692240403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0386747145159149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09963754655044749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0418060935658702,0.04798254392458721,0.09316045741547536,0.0,0.034120344968834856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0425988056668653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09452519262695804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032513941656049136,0.08015862860857852,0.0,0.0,0.0492782313082125,0.14038375041858478,0.04900861876483049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04531384507116934,0.04453297158129448,0.0,0.0484855192072174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1313883448437881,0.10143314994721685,0.0,0.05166222150909905,0.07019187520929239,0.04491758004633217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04292985487028279,0.038796350231086074,0.0,0.0,0.04472386176113245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8115482160885271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03819918047124527,0.09596508784917442,0.09360750232157318,0.037080914331901624,0.029550902515083865,0.038796350231086074,0.08042963093195751,0.0,0.05071657497360842,0.039945202922596734,0.0,0.0,0.06946539821139124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03004206805604321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
96,128,102680,Trajan,2011,7.48283,"Set in ancient Rome, Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence, trading, military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture.&#10;&#10;The central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile.&#10;&#10;What are you trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you &ndash; and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome.&#10;&#10;All game components are language neutral, and the playing time is 30 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,120,"['Area Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Mancala', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection']",12,120,3.6352,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Ancient', 'Political']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1810,12,78,166,0.0,0.0,0.23193944522058335,0.17701521623428026,0.25245788892826243,0.0,0.12098790691887405,0.11372843621891265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1006040126386607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0890025826806377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11901252105289842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10564510156606602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12457879126618014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08730273984970596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12613642798299324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.116555522896026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11901252105289842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11372843621891265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12167449724833389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09563151504723497,0.0,0.0944266467798008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08109035866533613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12382757496357223,0.3461834335831521,0.0,0.20414419497593245,0.0,0.11372843621891265,0.0,0.0,0.08754010317237604,0.0,0.0,0.09355192850563768,0.10400755186676805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07901778788463584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12167449724833389,0.0,0.12457879126618014,0.0,0.19704238927194237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.171377694448714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11776039116346015,0.0,0.18054934414093113,0.11063648423336533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2096316569047288,0.2841708831315632,0.07427944659357186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29657709240794655,0.10649649121673344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09818689608576713,0.0,0.0,0.09752862080901334,0.0,0.0,0.08480197853336469,0.10096475342416131,0.0,0.0,0.12031577220199233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way.

Age of Steam also allows towns to be developed into cities, ensuring that no two games are exactly the same.&#10;&#10;See also Age of Steam FAQ&#10;&#10;",1,6,120,120,"['Auction / Bidding', 'Catch the Leader', 'Connections', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Loans', 'Network and Route Building', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Player Elimination', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Selection Order Bid', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Tile Placement', 'Turn Order: Auction', 'Victory Points as a Resource']",13,120,3.8715,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Post-Napoleonic', 'Trains', 'Transportation']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1051,12,74,112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20925079614351305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2828957535832138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2290535273470835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2893232950468769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.298213323573353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27841059236978255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24221337313274274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20640223148820147,0.0,0.0,0.27148114172981774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19452801256278035,0.2893232950468769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2604158040062383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2581625619113856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2581625619113856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27556202771447097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

At the start of spring in the Great New Year, the Kami have gathered their sacred clans with one quest: reclaim the lands of Nippon and return them to their honorable, spiritual traditions. However, each clan is bound by their own proud traditions to a unique vision for this great return and must wage a powerful diplomatic war across eight provinces. Alliances must be forged, betrayal is inevitable, honorable standing rises and falls. Political mandates must be navigated and devastating war must be fought, each won by expert skill and cunning negotiation. And only one may stand victorious at the coming of winter. You, honorable Sh&#197;&#141;gun, lead one of these great clans. Do you have the strength of honor, virtue, and spirit, as well as the mastery of steel necessary to deliver on this ancient promise?&#10;&#10;Rising  Sun is a board game for 3 to 5 players set in legendary feudal Japan. Each player chooses a Clan and competes to lead theirs to victory by accumulating Victory Points over the course of the Seasons. Each Clan possesses a unique ability and differs in Seasonal Income, Starting Honor Rank, and Home Province.&#10;Over the course of the game, players will forge and break alliances, choose political actions, worship the gods, customize their clans, and position their figures around Japan. In the process, Honor is a palpable element in Rising Sun: Having high Honor gives several advantages, while having low Honor may grant the allegiance of the darker elements of the world. But above all, Honor settles all disputes: Whenever there is a tie, the tied player with the highest Honor wins.&#10;&#10;In Rising  Sun, players are encouraged to use diplomacy, negotiation, and even bribery to further their cause. Players can make deals at any point in the game but no deals are truly binding.&#10;Victory Points can be gained in several ways, from winning battles, to harvesting the right provinces, to playing to the Virtues accumulated by your Clan.&#10;&#10;The game is played over the course of 4 rounds or Seasons: Spring, Summer, and then Autumn; when  Winter  comes,  the  game  draws to a close and players calculate bonuses to decide who is the winner. &#10;Each Season is divided into five phases: &#10;1) Seasonal Setup because every Season has a certain Season deck with different cards, &#10;2) Tea Ceremony in which players sit down and negotiate their Alliances for the Season, &#10;3) Political Phase during which players will select Political Mandates to prepare their Clans and position their forces,&#10;4) War Phase, during which players battle over several Provinces, and &#10;5) Seasonal Cleanup.&#10;&#10;As already mentioned, the start of the Winter Season signifies the end of the game. Peace falls over the land as it gets covered in white snow, and a new Emperor will rise under the power of the great Kami.&#10;&#10;",3,5,90,120,"['Action Drafting', 'Alliances', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Auction: Sealed Bid', 'Betting and Bluffing', 'Closed Drafting', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Follow', 'Force Commitment', 'Negotiation', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Take That', 'Variable Phase Order', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up']",14,120,3.2996,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Bluffing', 'Fantasy', 'Miniatures', 'Mythology', 'Negotiation', 'Wargame']",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3018,21,139,257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07918496186004789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11651783007064902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0914663627732148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10805084622437162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10187918150780632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08422170464819775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11080880208365324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30309873254694875,0.0,0.0750478500300481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06693740801282765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11080880208365324,0.0,0.0,0.06627423269845169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09116444443555728,0.0,0.08722827396836733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08237246726996503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10912383963282336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4950800222453404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10967505916666798,0.10552493710617798,0.10061855087637381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11139213345565153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07742311763471205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14905078253195106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07838913726132801,0.08237246726996503,0.0,0.09500463839384898,0.0,0.0978678154525872,0.10274998513796649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0978678154525872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09207945796587073,0.0978678154525872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0743532382347721,0.0,0.0,0.31231629319987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16126098799519611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17038168201370568,0.06789115864938852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23938793586110854,0.0,0.33964000436190656,0.0,0.11321333478730217,0.0885756128610197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09569525781464472,0.10650996377027225,0.06901957757491414,0.0,0.0,0.08398422814089872,0.0

While on the trail, these hikers will take actions and collect memories of the places your hikers visit. These memories are represented by various resource tokens like mountains and forests. Collecting these memories in sets will allow players to trade them in to visit a National Park at the end of each hike.&#10;&#10;Each trail represents one season of the year, and each season, the trails will change and grow steadily longer. The trails, represented by tiles, get shuffled in between each season and laid out anew for the next round. Resources can be tough to come by especially when someone is at the place you&rsquo;re trying to reach! Campfires allow you to share a space and time with other hikers. Canteens and Gear can also be used to improve your access to resources through the game. It&rsquo;ll be tough to manage building up your engine versus spending resources on parks, but we bet you&rsquo;re up to the challenge.

On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station.

112,152,118048,Targi,2012,7.42195,"Unlike in other cultures, the desert Tuareg men, known as Targi, cover their faces whereas women of the tribe do not wear veils. They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the &lsquo;Imascheren&rsquo; (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round their new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.&#10;&#10;The game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.&#10;&#10;The display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).&#10;&#10;The winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.&#10;&#10;",2,2,60,60,"['End Game Bonuses', 'Modular Board', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection', 'Square Grid', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Worker Placement']",12,60,2.3347,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Arabian', 'Card Game']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2170,19,87,194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16775624174078554,0.07975093430831726,0.0,0.0,0.10777974597331087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11735063822011396,0.0,0.0,0.0860487568388054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23612512266475952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21159015626370947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06741584138961935,0.11278744097064788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08948755774192238,0.0,0.20024377814097574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11531017958967521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23470127644022792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21980759885721513,0.10882313682777266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11402252414297245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15188040363579894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11102449555998353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11531017958967521,0.0,0.0,0.09745350397223476,0.0,0.0,0.11102449555998353,0.0,0.0,0.08976900476024184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11531017958967521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11597515880378444,0.2078652467554476,0.0,0.15369767752739366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23470127644022792,0.0,0.07471228051950872,0.2901993143660198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07894942157404801,0.08296122232996199,0.0,0.09568368156727053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09856732310931086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07523244237952617,0.0,0.09856732310931086,0.0,0.11402252414297245,0.08120679834909403,0.0,0.10438759941450731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11160080510457938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23470127644022792,0.1720975136776108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07039417889720308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11806256133237976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21659388760663878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24109895488495958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09637923717235214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

115,157,147020,Star Realms,2014,7.41374,"Star Realms is a spaceship combat deck-building game by Magic Hall of Famers Darwin Kastle (The Battle for Hill 218) and Rob Dougherty (Ascension Co-designer).&#10;&#10;Star Realms is a fast paced deck-building card game of outer space combat. It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. As you play, you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row from the Trade Deck. You use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their bases. When you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s score (called Authority) to zero, you win!&#10;&#10;Multiple decks of Star Realms and/or Star Realms: Colony Wars, one for every two people, allows up to six players to play a variety of scenarios. Also, in the newest version, there are new ways to play that allow up to 6 players with modes like Boss, Hunter, and Free for All. You can also add Star Realms Colony Wars to the deck to make it 4 players. This is the first game of the Star Realms series. When you play Star Realms, you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions. Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together, however.&#10;&#10;As you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you draw Ships, you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you draw a Base, you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s Authority to zero and win the game, it&rsquo;s also useful for destroying your opponent&rsquo;s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent&rsquo;s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent&rsquo;s Authority directly.&#10;&#10;Star Realms is easy to learn, especially if you&rsquo;re familiar with deck-building games, but it&rsquo;s a game that takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent&rsquo;s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you&rsquo;ll be faced with. New players needn&rsquo;t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.&#10;&#10;",2,2,20,20,"['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Delayed Purchase', 'Hand Management', 'Income', 'Open Drafting', 'Tags', 'Take That', 'Variable Set-up']",12,20,1.9232,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Fighting', 'Science Fiction']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2790,26,111,208,0.09731649537112476,0.05224826854366395,0.20581511830972415,0.0,0.0,0.047443388682194214,0.05368026200302413,0.0,0.0,0.04597040837181645,0.053089981876286475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04463627724893214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05094784460930418,0.04528764135101743,0.0,0.0,0.12895684146753184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15795568594953957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054614535063093494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3778942326053681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24770452380886415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10560763425792252,0.08276070005722073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0418954858240959,0.0,0.031249448080305574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08225928260570708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08276070005722073,0.0,0.05171368913054654,0.0,0.0,0.04597040837181645,0.0,0.03677787593852965,0.054614535063093494,0.0,0.054614535063093494,0.0,0.0,0.03873473033843344,0.03563706926988027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04668776029786832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047443388682194214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05171368913054654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042027251176327794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07301268068239282,0.0,0.06763921571744877,0.0,0.0351400121918721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494017407624666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38926598148449904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04975683473064275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04528764135101743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04844839683667988,0.0,0.0,0.054614535063093494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5076100623899038,0.0,0.0,0.03801867382353256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04495821549832274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043712166575921176,0.0,0.0,0.047443388682194214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047250669066870164,0.0,0.0,0.04005332576113611,0.09817502611600298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06591303637075405,0.0,0.04844839683667988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3316408552966893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1600592832948347,0.0,0.08712768807021089,0.0,0.05494017407624666,0.043271778569835835,0.047060536370231165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0418954858240959,0.053382047341556084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07746946067686689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

117,159,161970,Alchemists,2014,7.41304,"In Alchemists, two to four budding alchemists compete to discover the secrets of their mystical art. Points can be earned in various ways, but most points are earned by publishing theories &ndash; correct theories, that is &mdash; and therein lies the problem.&#10;&#10;The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards.&#10;Players declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces, then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS, Android, and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there's academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don't want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.&#10;&#10;During play, players' reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition, reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants. Then the secrets of alchemy are revealed and players score points or lose points based on whether their theories were correct. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Flavor text:&#10;Mandrake root and scorpion tail; spongy mushroom and warty toad &mdash; these are the foundations of the alchemist's livelihood, science, and art.&#10;&#10;But what arcane secrets do these strange ingredients hide? Now it is time to find out. Mix them into potions and drink them to determine their effects &mdash; or play it safe and test the concoction on a helpful assistant! Gain riches selling potions to wandering adventurers and invest these riches in powerful artifacts. As your knowledge grows, so will your reputation, as you publish your theories for all to see. Knowledge, wealth, and fame can all be found in the murky depths of the alchemist's cauldron.&#10;&#10;",2,4,120,120,"['Action Drafting', 'Action Queue', 'Constrained Bidding', 'Deduction', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Events', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Worker Placement']",13,120,3.9243,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Deduction', 'Fantasy', 'Puzzle']",False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2438,26,102,207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1804328304903064,0.08577735565709023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11704641446968658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10146753802232567,0.0,0.0,0.1269840209525722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12473888275265325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1824668458241649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12003397871258248,0.11941412003375797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12547018536475385,0.0,0.0,0.07251015494618823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22862043115829653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1435835364579264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09875416733104818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269840209525722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269840209525722,0.10561136615082144,0.0,0.08449265211171897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20808558558560375,0.0,0.0,0.16374357785827068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11227570333598252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11880584817959276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11537724876970613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24446003034325028,0.0,0.0,0.33682711000794757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09747786270086405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16531192346872692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1159241792358457,0.0,0.08491527619097006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22260848049702542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08091742150620991,0.19949071715435457,0.0,0.09228324287996346,0.0,0.08734323283078316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11130424024851271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20084666606205728,0.0,0.0,0.10899535747049893,0.12621830099542108,0.09255107646360095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07571355209595952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10008258021369855,0.0,0.0,0.19882319137012378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20582813870607083,0.0,0.0,0.122638696225417,0.0,0.1269840209525722,0.10899535747049893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07476567158558658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version.&#10;&#10;More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponent's route to connect yours. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.&#10;&#10;The overall goal remains the same: collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;From the official website:  In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalker&mdash;a powerful wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and conquest. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.&#10;&#10;This is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.  Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare.  Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.&#10;&#10;Players build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck.  Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total to zero.  The first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.&#10;&#10;An important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck.  There are over 25,000 different cards from which to build your deck!&#10;&#10;Cards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used.  Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect.&#10;&#10;Players randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called &quot;the stack,&quot; provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.&#10;&#10;Though traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.&#10;&#10;",2,2,20,20,"['Betting and Bluffing', 'Closed Drafting', 'Deck Construction', 'Hand Management', 'Income', 'Interrupts', 'Player Elimination', 'Tags', 'Take That']",13,20,3.2673,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2070,20,138,179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22072022944062267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09671257733211193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27167891539055483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1311118732339707,0.0,0.0,0.11532324965859923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10677735049714314,0.0,0.12676492383729163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1288689851296187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5097073897100279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07577052839957646,0.0,0.09934086596289314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0855531023590136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13034768806045982,0.0,0.12478350073921524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1343528777049022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25352984767458325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08515067388575157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35043824844246013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1200030383433729,0.11343360747754895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11630896531667881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10388157547990685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09643270078005622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11630896531667881,0.0,0.08416495822767199,0.0,0.0,0.11784327710556226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1343528777049022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11343360747754895,0.2508624619463457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0791179642848259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1288689851296187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10089386684766591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10388157547990685,0.0,0.1343528777049022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929895868932636,0.0,0.0,0.07812746292423829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

125,170,77423,The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game,2011,7.39609,"The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with up to three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them. Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.&#10;&#10;The core set contains three scenarios, twelve famous heroes from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor, and &Eacute;owyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances of success and to explore new strategies. Additionally, The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a Living Card Game with over ten years of content, and its content is re-released regularly in the form of Campaign and Hero Expansions. Campaign Expansions contain new scenarios for players to embark upon, and Hero Expansions contain new heroes and new cards for players to use in their decks.&#10;&#10;Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle-earth, most scenarios in the game do not represent scenes from The Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit but take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire, allowing players to create their own stories and adventures in Middle-earth. Scenarios from the game's Saga Expansions do follow the events of the books, and these scenarios can be played individually or together as a Campaign Mode, with lasting consequences from game to game arising from the players' actions and decisions.&#10;&#10;",1,2,30,60,"['Cooperative Game', 'Deck Construction', 'Events', 'Hand Management', 'Player Elimination', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Variable Set-up']",13,60,3.2097,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Fantasy', 'Novel-based']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2006,13,70,171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13165215120187979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19145078706501753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1961002112333432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1715710739492254,0.0,0.0,0.16334233314762064,0.0,0.1892789124107193,0.0,0.18618853009214523,0.0,0.0,0.17544473911631425,0.2495476582281936,0.0,0.0,0.1925731994001271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14772528478450495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19733348986690752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1296803722386654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15968617105640032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16728742885679007,0.0,0.0,0.18327827508662817,0.19733348986690752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1287229260447341,0.19145078706501753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15156912298925865,0.14772528478450495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12333438519435395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13032902092638604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16271408276402094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12419306388493485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2472379485320544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1961002112333432,0.239550272122547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1708311308311626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2257503665803925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19489665306893664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
126,173,328871,Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition,2021,7.39277,"Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition is an engine-building game in which players control interplanetary corporations with the goal of making Mars habitable (and profitable). You will do this by investing mega credits (MC) into project cards that will directly or indirectly contribute to the terraforming process. In order to win, you will want to accumulate a high terraform rating (TR) and as many victory points (VP) as you can. Players raise their TR by increasing global parameters: oceans, oxygen, and temperature. TR also determines each corporation's basic income, and, at the end of the game TR counts as VP. Additional VP and production capabilities are awarded for building project cards and other actions taken during the game.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds, and each round the players will choose one of five phases, which determines which activities will take place during that round. This means every round is different, but can consist of building new project cards, taking general and project-specific actions, producing income and resources (plants and heat), or researching to draw more project cards. Every player will take all the phases selected for the round, and will receive a special bonus during the phase that they selected.

128,177,148949,Istanbul,2014,7.38467,"There's hustle and bustle at Istanbul's grand bazaar as merchants and their assistants rush through the narrow alleys in their attempt to be more successful than their competitors. Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.&#10;&#10;In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...&#10;&#10;In more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action. Possible actions include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good.&#10;    Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit.&#10;    Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect.&#10;    Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies.&#10;    Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow, players complete that round, then the game ends.

129,180,103885,Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game,2012,7.38349,"Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game is a tactical ship-to-ship combat game in which players take control of powerful Rebel X-wings and nimble Imperial TIE fighters, facing them against each other in fast-paced space combat. Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, the X-Wing Miniatures Game recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission!&#10;&#10;Whatever your chosen vessel, the rules of X-Wing facilitate fast and visceral gameplay that puts you in the middle of Star Wars fiercest firefights. Each ship type has its own unique piloting dial, which is used to secretly select a speed and maneuver each turn. After planning maneuvers, each ship's dial is revealed and executed (starting with the lowest skilled pilot). So whether you rush headlong toward your enemy showering his forward deflectors in laser fire, or dance away from him as you attempt to acquire a targeting lock, you'll be in total control throughout all the tense dogfighting action.&#10;&#10;Star Wars: X-Wing features (three) unique missions, and each has its own set of victory conditions and special rules; with such a broad selection of missions, only clever and versatile pilots employing a range of tactics will emerge victorious. What's more, no mission will ever play the same way twice, thanks to a range of customization options, varied maneuvers, and possible combat outcomes. Damage, for example, is determined through dice and applied in the form of a shuffled Damage Deck. For some hits your fighter sustains, you'll draw a card that assigns a special handicap. Was your targeting computer damaged, affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy? Perhaps an ill-timed weapon malfunction will limit your offensive capabilities. Or worse yet, your pilot could be injured, compromising his ability to focus on the life-and-death struggle in which he is engaged...&#10;&#10;The Star Wars: X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships.

To date they have put out various titles with different Spanish publishers (1987 Channel Tunnel, Mondrian, Smoothies), and The Red Cathedral is the first game they have published with Devir. Pedro Soto (Holmes, Sherlock &amp; Mycroft, Papua) and Chema Rom&aacute;n (El mundo de &Aacute;guila Roja) took care of the graphic elements of the game with a grand homage to Ivan Bilibin, an iconic Russian artist from the turn of the twentieth century. Despite being from a far later period, his mark is very recognizable in the game.&#10;&#10;The Red Cathedral is a strategic, &ldquo;Euro&rdquo; board game in which the players take the roles of construction teams. Their job is to work together to put up St. Basil's cathedral in Moscow, as ordered by Ivan the Terrible. However, only one of them will be able to gain the favor of the Tsar.&#10;&#10;During the game, the players can carry out one of these three actions: assign a section of the cathedral, send resources to that section to build it, or go to the game board to achieve more resources. Each of these actions has its own mechanism and requires that the players pay close attention to what the other players are doing.&#10;&#10;When the sections of the cathedral are assigned the players take possession of the spaces in each of the columns that make up their section. The more sections built and the completion of each with its own tower, the more points the player will be given at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The players can send resources to the cathedral sections that they have claimed. When they complete each of those sections they will obtain rewards in money and prestige points. They will also be able to install decorations on the completed sections to achieve even more recognition from the Tsar. This part of the game also works as a clock, since once any player completes the construction of their sixth section it brings about the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game board shows us the iconic rondel of The Red Cathedral. It is where the players obtain all the resource types needed to complete their work on the cathedral, as well as to get favors from the guilds and professionals to make the most of their trip to the market. In the central rondel the players choose the die they wish to use and move forward as many spaces as is shown on the top side of said die, in order to obtain the resources indicated in the space destined by the die.&#10;&#10;The Red Cathedral is a very accessible game with regard to its rules because it is very easy to understand the various levels of the game, but it remains very interesting with regard to strategy. It is sure to please those who are more interested in the challenge offered by trying to strategically optimize their position in each game rather than the complexity of the rules.&#10;&#10;",1,4,80,80,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Contracts', 'Dice Rolling', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Rondel', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Victory Points as a Resource']",10,80,2.8192,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Dice', 'Economic']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3296,24,111,274,0.0,0.21723059206115453,0.0,0.0,0.15523492559925195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11159216775929827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17871961312885468,0.10861529603057726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07841876272617337,0.0,0.0,0.11287262841752893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08255450118175532,0.0,0.0,0.09414533168226642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1926017516758744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08524438266998521,0.31320466499711774,0.065612354344776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.129924613719899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08935980656442734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09414533168226642,0.0,0.0,0.07408342776326567,0.0,0.0,0.11561376484507824,0.1015950557140092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09862676505928286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11222543851484881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10750399602339948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2276714850275875,0.0,0.07030523348622705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1015950557140092,0.0,0.08498943774229561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0747930031875955,0.0,0.0,0.09822613363832337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07271360146677819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2270687262485218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3672602307444298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11490418942074837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09593048158054959,0.16700890617096906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10071600669838868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10028613110459714,0.0,0.0,0.11490418942074837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09862676505928286,0.22842262289614673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11561376484507824,0.09822613363832337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09822613363832337,0.0,0.07061519377150363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06851101631914112,0.0,0.10071600669838868,0.0,0.10343602734503718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09822613363832337,0.0,0.0,0.10539981857103697,0.0,0.06654722509314133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17990938915820842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08682222198130525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19806584520981965,0.0,0.0

140,204,155426,Castles of Mad King Ludwig,2014,7.33373,"In the tile-laying game Castles of Mad King Ludwig, players are tasked with building an amazing, extravagant castle for King Ludwig II of Bavaria...one room at a time. You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he's commissioned you to build the biggest, best castle ever &mdash; subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he's building while also selling his services to other players.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room.

143,209,287954,Azul: Summer Pavilion,2019,7.32631,"At the turn of the 16th Century, King Manuel I commissioned Portugal's greatest artisans to construct grandiose buildings. After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra, the king sought to build a summer pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans &mdash; whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began.&#10;&#10;In Azul: Summer Pavilion, players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan, you must use the finest materials to create the summer pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family.&#10;&#10;Azul: Summer Pavilion lasts six rounds, and in each round players draft tiles, then place them on their individual player board to score points. Each of the six colors of tiles is wild during one of the rounds.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, draw tiles at random from the bag to refill each of the five, seven, or nine factories with four tiles each. Draw tiles as needed to refill the ten supply spaces on the central scoring board. Players then take turns drafting tiles. You can choose to take all of the tiles of a non-wild color on a factory and place them next to your board; if any wild tiles are on this factory, you must take one of them. Place all remaining tiles in the center of the table. Alternatively, you can take all tiles of a non-wild color from the center of play; you must also take one wild tile, if present.&#10;&#10;After all tiles have been claimed, players then take turns placing tiles on their individual boards. Each board depicts seven stars that would be composed of six tiles; each space on a star shows a number from 1-6, and six of the stars are for tiles of a single color while the seventh will be composed of one tile of each color. To place a tile on the blue 5, for example, you must discard five blue or wild tiles from next to your player board (with at least one blue being required), placing one blue tile in the blue 5 space and the rest in the discard tower. You score 1 point for this tile and 1 point for each tile within this star connected to the newly placed tile.&#10;&#10;If you completely surround a pillar, statue, or window on your game board with tiles, you get an immediate bonus, taking 1-3 tiles from the central supply spaces and placing them next to your board.

144,210,17133,Railways of the World,2005,7.32516,"Railways of the World (2009) is the new edition of the base game for Eagle Games' popular Railways of the World series, first published as Railroad Tycoon in 2005.  It reimplements the original game with several improvements.&#10;&#10;Revisit the early days of the Age of Steam as you begin with a locomotive (the venerable John Bull, the first locomotive to run in North America) and a vision (your Tycoon &quot;mission&quot; card). From there, build your budding railroad network into a vast empire. Connect New York to Chicago, earn the most money, develop bigger and faster locomotives and maybe even span North America and build the Transcontinental Railway!&#10;&#10;Multiple expansions featuring different maps are available.  Railways of the World is the new base game for the system and includes the engine placards, railroad tiles, train tokens, money, bonds, and other items that are needed in almost all the Railways of the World series. A gameboard depicting the eastern half of the United States is included in the base game, as well as a mounted map of Mexico.&#10;&#10;This game is preceded by the designer's other Winsome train games: Age of Steam, Australian Railways, Volldampf, New England Railways, Veld Spoorweg, Lancashire Railways, and Ferrocarriles Pampas.  Railroad Tycoon was the result of a collaboration with Glenn Drover, in which the mechanics and game-play of Martin Wallace's Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined and attractive over-produced components were added, in order to make Railroad Tycoon more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience.&#10;&#10;A revised reprint was published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements, such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map.&#10;&#10;Complete series overview - The Railways of the World Series: Introducing the family members of the ideal medium-weight train game&#10;&#10;Note: The RailRoad Tycoon board itself is gigantic (about 36x45 inches, 91x114 cm) and requires a huge table or playing on the floor.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;     Steam&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,6,120,120,"['Action Points', 'Connections', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Income', 'Loans', 'Network and Route Building', 'Open Drafting', 'Ownership', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Tile Placement', 'Turn Order: Auction']",10,120,3.0151,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,"['Trains', 'Transportation', 'Video Game Theme']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2125,12,113,185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13352943186492916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11103255683214801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18766931487454888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11523211258402478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07851071069679388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12376992259474452,0.10554461348936399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07773287410595593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10692653831983401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13428719368552336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19270496612855095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13506161093853344,0.11063887042786183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13666345798662902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13428719368552336,0.09080937207335317,0.0,0.0,0.261303083679588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2431340898232011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13666345798662902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08949613063036232,0.1210371918197813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09661445130910971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1327876241159771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4473335076355544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12210498767550669,0.0,0.13428719368552336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1299673540000356,0.11063887042786183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10454261516278696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1358534322751869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1038901045404995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49252440708490297,0.0

146,212,242302,Space Base,2018,7.32147,"In Space Base, players assume the roles of Commodores of a small fleet of ships. Ships begin docked at their stations and are then deployed to sectors as new ships are commissioned under your command. Use cargo vessels to engage in trade and commerce; mining vessels to build reoccurring base income; and carriers to spread your influence. Establish new colonies for a new Commodore in a sector to gain even more influence. Gain enough influence and you can be promoted to Admiral!&#10;&#10;Space Base is a quick-to-learn, quick-to-play dice game using the core &quot;I roll, everyone gets stuff&quot; mechanism seen in other games. It's also a strategic engine builder using a player board (your space base) and tableaus of ship cards you can buy and add to your board. The cards you buy and the order you buy them in have interesting implications on your engine beyond just the ability on the card you buy, making for a different type of engine construction than seen in similar games. Players can take their engine in a number of directions: long odds and explosive gains, low luck and steady income, big end-game combos to launch from last to first, or a mix-and-match approach. Ultimately, Space Base is a game you can just start playing and teach everyone how to play in the first round or two and has a satisfying blend of dice-chucking luck and challenging strategic choices.&#10;&#10;",2,5,60,60,"['Dice Rolling', 'Open Drafting', 'Random Production']",14,60,2.1234,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Dice', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1393,10,48,139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11312243842559266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08994436401285745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5178483528450654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1955463595286084,0.0,0.07525573316597899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07451014492193797,0.0,0.10838204048996088,0.0,0.10249346827639737,0.0,0.0,0.22624487685118533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21596469234051588,0.0,0.184715606087635,0.0,0.1226846811260018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1087865216817341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12031361823088385,0.0,0.2518073315470819,0.0,0.0,0.12946208821126634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08340068641290696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08578570829802952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09260891034059567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13179223798710443,0.11220957810323567,0.08398133869482925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1287197775426401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12089096179119337,0.0,0.45248975370237066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09065046169940548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13179223798710443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12393570473239057,0.0,0.0,0.07632800658592008,0.0,0.20774436233695354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
147,214,103343,A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition),2011,7.31652,"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;King Robert Baratheon is dead, and the lands of Westeros brace for battle.&#10;&#10;In the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare. Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!&#10;&#10;To begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.&#10;&#10;Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.&#10;&#10;The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!&#10;&#10;During the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.&#10;&#10;In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.&#10;&#10;Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; A Dance with Dragons (2012)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; A Feast for Crows (2013)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; Mother of Dragons (2018)&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;     A Game of Thrones (2003)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)&#10;&#10;&#10;",3,6,120,240,"['Advantage Token', 'Alliances', 'Area Movement', 'Auction / Bidding', 'Auction: Sealed Bid', 'Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Events', 'Hand Management', 'Income', 'Negotiation', 'Order Counters', 'Player Elimination', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Sudden Death Ending', 'Turn Order: Auction', 'Variable Player Powers']",14,240,3.7287,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Bluffing', 'Fantasy', 'Negotiation', 'Novel-based', 'Political', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3851,29,228,285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17483510150771223,0.0,0.07040926471249122,0.07966521536909761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06554641326143074,0.529270835007105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06379361901680448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05893533792191222,0.08305529004557262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2403519147094954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07966521536909761,0.20868795857244254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10503160486501792,0.0,0.06487187347044711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09368081012683065,0.0,0.06141129670514972,0.0,0.0,0.3148457327813557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08202965477613255,0.14977034640404993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06141129670514972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06928786001493341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06600843962060074,0.07713961936536395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0756101192867293,0.0,0.08202965477613255,0.0,0.062371342676097515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16023460980633025,0.05417792978460401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10430040893542947,0.0,0.07317517779087197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08057933126233513,0.0,0.0,0.10678886926712515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07488517320202497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2054531952115147,0.0,0.0,0.06358444959835026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08202965477613255,0.0,0.0522713653398038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3564570447992518,0.0,0.0,0.06672109610944912,0.052029737931082225,0.0,0.07598218834688411,0.0,0.0715938796906792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06487187347044711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059786521126970575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512357381282788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08105174110065567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06141129670514972,0.0,0.0,0.05961350489832679,0.14252341698467938,0.062371342676097515,0.0,0.07129140895985037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07922264422012043,0.06217579379514854,0.0,0.061982047233668486,0.0,0.0,0.05748501440811479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
148,215,70149,Ora et Labora,2011,7.31532,"In Ora et Labora (Latin for 'Pray and work'), each player is head of a monastery in the Medieval era who acquires land and constructs buildings &ndash; little enterprises that will gain resources and profit. The goal is to build a working infrastructure and manufacture prestigious items &ndash; such as books, ceramics, ornaments, and relics &ndash; to gain the most victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Ora et Labora, Uwe Rosenberg's fifth &quot;big&quot; game, has game play mechanisms similar to his Le Havre, such as two-sided resource tiles that can be upgraded from a basic item to something more useful. Instead of adding resources to the board turn by turn as in Agricola and Le Havre, Ora et Labora uses a numbered rondel to show how many of each resource is available at any time. At the beginning of each round, players turn the rondel by one segment, adjusting the counts of all resources at the same time.&#10;&#10;Each player has a personal game board. New buildings enter the game from time to time, and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather, with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where. Some spaces start with trees or moors on them, as in Agricola: Farmers of the Moor, so they hinder development until a player clears the land, but they provide resources when they are removed. Clever building on your personal game board will impact your final score, and players can buy additional terrain during the game, if needed.&#10;&#10;Players also have three workers who can enter buildings to take the action associated with that location. Workers must stay in place until you've placed all three. You can enter your own buildings with these workers, but to enter and use another player's buildings, you must pay that player an entry fee so that he'll move one of his workers into that building to do the work for you.&#10;&#10;Ora et Labora features two variants: France and Ireland.&#10;&#10;",1,4,60,180,"['Increase Value of Unchosen Resources', 'Modular Board', 'Network and Route Building', 'Worker Placement', 'Worker Placement, Different Worker Types']",13,180,3.8892,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['City Building', 'Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing', 'Medieval', 'Religious', 'Territory Building']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,1982,13,83,180,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08228340584486368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1057306063577855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08441277305620519,0.0,0.0,0.09352914373883765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11581792186555005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07904235850753981,0.24823071556490442,0.5011777900020047,0.11377020563586243,0.11377020563586243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06547889522601634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10891366582948835,0.11581792186555005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18978797420269047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09319751891324553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1057306063577855,0.11511953404082254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22011069879094763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11726601945687534,0.11377020563586243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07086430947118086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0856652843508664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26671899506457086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07329182909427821,0.09489398710134524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37018072990297435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07380210148699158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07966287127778403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11311786919836049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11511953404082254,0.0,0.0,0.07966287127778403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14235346919860667,0.0,0.0,0.0880622905511914,0.2762232978616501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06707641692666505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0788383706728706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19964088951314424,0.0,0.0

This version was initially available only in the Nordic Countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland; a worldwide limited-edition release occurred in August 2008 and it has since been kept in print again by Days of Wonder.&#10;&#10;The goal in &quot;Nordic&quot; remains the same as base Ticket to Ride: collect and play cards to place your trains on the board, attempting to connect the different cities on your ticket cards. The map incorporates tunnels from Europe and also has routes containing ferries. Ferries will require a certain number of Locomotives to be played, as well as other cards, in order to be claimed. Locomotives are handled a bit differently as well. On your turn you may take 2 Locomotives if you want, but you can only use them on ferries, tunnels, or the special 9 length route.&#10;&#10;Unlike the USA or Europe maps, Nordic is designed for 2-3 players only and has a heavier focus on blocking your opponent and more aggressive play.&#10;&#10;Although not an official expansion for this set, Ticket to Ride Map Collection 5: United Kingdom & Pennsylvania can be used as an expansion for Nordic Countries, although limited to the three players included in this set.  Nordic Countries includes three sets of 40 trains, with 5 spare for each colour; the UK map in Ticket to Ride Map Collection 5: United Kingdom & Pennsylvania requires 35 trains and the Pennsylvania map requires 45 trains.&#10;&#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10;",2,3,30,60,"['Hand Management', 'Network and Route Building', 'Open Drafting', 'Push Your Luck', 'Set Collection']",8,60,1.9705,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Trains'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1672,11,74,147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13722016747219887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11280708069080897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12140357736342168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2640889880977321,0.0,0.0,0.11240710238496555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07976546996080419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10723142896163274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25504694186434973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11240710238496555,0.0,0.0,0.11799169347889062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13722016747219887,0.11240710238496555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6636980829407024,0.08880763439785654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08839851353393748,0.0,0.0,0.12297160989315974,0.0,0.09092645902765845,0.0,0.0,0.11941430528345981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08839851353393748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09341183889692237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11362069948508986,0.17720497900867843,0.12939160013527082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13968995261851933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10181167196479057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10122481151090694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17169492464663275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08090199989241008,0.10621341668394461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11893379221710122,0.0,0.0,0.1132115786211708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21110095525573755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office. A third one might want to seek his luck in distant lands.&#10;&#10;Each player will take the reins of a family and have them find fame and glory in many different ways. There is one thing you must not forget, however: Time will not stop for anyone and with time people will vanish.

A smart and unique new action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short and yet still tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, thoughts of death will keep you focused on smart time-management.&#10;&#10;Paraphrased from Opinionated Gamer's review:&#10;&#10;Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of taking a cube and then taking the action of the area they just took the cube from.  The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house.  Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold.  Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,90,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Contracts', 'Set Collection', 'Turn Order: Claim Action', 'Worker Placement', 'Worker Placement, Different Worker Types']",12,90,3.0611,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Farming', 'Medieval']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,1922,17,76,191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14969534111019892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10119000049639428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0767846124437934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08631866670191686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10600234611203671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1006445678196349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09440501375322466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12031549191050539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0798531866372805,0.0,0.05956173942810455,0.15138285340160354,0.0,0.0,0.08193098076721202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2057914088684316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1752400540201101,0.0,0.0700989744759818,0.0,0.31414945224518437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06792458632802724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10174667999657719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09042754121651367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08762002701005504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3019337034589047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10348909094105642,0.09617600913577672,0.0,0.1006445678196349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12892097586270848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2819395188714079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20943296816345625,0.08087209998339477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1905519849736043,0.09006021583268232,0.0948369909567,0.10471648408172812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13426559879611927,0.0,0.08795541019550733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2794471992197177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1066689972479302,0.0,0.0,0.21200469222407342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1871225152150447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.188446292898094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15774266601535117,0.0,0.0,0.1531248108687585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07171395416409078,0.17076445206759605,0.0,0.0798531866372805,0.10174667999657719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
156,225,150376,Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game,2014,7.2983,"&quot;Crossroads&quot; is a game series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors' ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside. Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first title in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world in which most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors, with dozens of different characters in the game.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition, but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective, which could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for their own interests!&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games, a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily-thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what's best for the colony and what's best for themselves. The rulebook also includes a fully co-operative variant in which all players work toward the group objective with no personal goals.&#10;&#10;",2,5,60,120,"['Action Points', 'Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Narrative Choice / Paragraph', 'Push Your Luck', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Semi-Cooperative Game', 'Storytelling', 'Trading', 'Traitor Game', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Voting']",13,120,3.0106,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,"['Bluffing', 'Deduction', 'Horror', 'Zombies']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1992,11,79,177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1864019541380536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10643105383547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10044041125164782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11448870707567263,0.3472272600820211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06843273019311416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09083737246861166,0.0,0.06775474013185086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12058347326905995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19934515739178632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25195276230928687,0.07726793642039566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09643677788245998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35953018930106195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09643677788245998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09967257869589316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11772450788910582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.113880534677189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10838165865756158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11841468755263763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10993047603159563,0.0,0.19495590450446257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10993047603159563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12058347326905995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31513598534972254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16315709967068914,0.0,0.0,0.09083737246861166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21777860332364862,0.0,0.0,0.413159584991904,0.17172072225269558,0.0

If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card&mdash;in order to make sure you get it, or, why not, your opponents don't get it&mdash;you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.&#10;&#10;All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,30,"['Contracts', 'Open Drafting', 'Race', 'Set Collection']",10,30,1.781,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Economic', 'Renaissance']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1164,9,61,120,0.0,0.0,0.12183444742625771,0.0,0.0,0.11233847331712177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11947981655475624,0.0,0.08932102841232524,0.09350354761858333,0.0,0.0,0.514259541944594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21063385232904336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1128010974189519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07473419323247295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09920191299750934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10763092745428407,0.0,0.10178316443134972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09798215255409978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12931861868068795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2531489043979717,0.0,0.24127294618629175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12640028184039445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26503059001481355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24489974463827235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08644126514226867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0832060152453129,0.2519581313658339,0.11675150694021015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22023297553159715,0.255573579479568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08282270003743426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0919671088072218,0.0,0.1060706593590611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12570871681124307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08339932826245398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08043255861139896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1118821436162905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07579903554537928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09171774174307912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, et cetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his/her meeples in one of the areas on it: in the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, in the cloister as a monk, or in the field as a farmer. When that area is complete that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him/her a hard time to complete his/her project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;First game in the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;",2,5,30,45,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Enclosure', 'Map Addition', 'Pattern Building', 'Tile Placement']",7,45,1.8911,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Medieval', 'Territory Building']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1193,8,54,115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12403069817422743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2359071238788432,0.3067186009077045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20916080401369785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09341859196914085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09704257009551046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12403069817422743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11391499309135708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10300094077485271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09487900963890923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11131375566185644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10984887714405815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39482598712595224,0.204479067271803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08344353321635543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0858294087573651,0.11985377965920607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10149583525501073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12478314675056217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6299265920283723,0.09487900963890923,0.07440129247226421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09341859196914085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07226866310533922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09458154154916829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1185745055091054

160,231,215,Tichu,1991,7.28758,"Tichu took much of its rules and mechanics from Zheng Fen. It is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.&#10;&#10;The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.&#10;&#10;The last player out in a round gives all the cards they won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses &mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call &quot;Tichu&quot; prior to playing any card. This indicates that the player thinks they can empty their hand first this round; if they do so, their team scores 100 points, and if not, their team instead loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call &quot;Grand Tichu&quot; after looking at only their first eight cards for a &plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).&#10;&#10;The first team to 1,000 points wins.&#10;&#10;",4,4,60,60,"['Hand Management', 'Ladder Climbing', 'Predictive Bid', 'Team-Based Game']",10,60,2.3409,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Card Game'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1939,14,92,164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07673975409712064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08797832638020926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061697826271448424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18219475221654574,0.1460936002565125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18933613697257284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06412400047354158,0.0,0.09579084323330675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19274394201588976,0.18596514031222164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08797832638020926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15909846700673036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061268306038066135,0.18552802770074692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08883002426005669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07304680012825625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1933342275780731,0.06771949060683326,0.0,0.0781045649176969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30705325524172405,0.0,0.0,0.07003651278824012,0.0,0.0,0.09256494389902525,0.08520938891069785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17853429402988788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2732921283248186,0.07621427063647765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07023977970453116,0.0,0.13257478285795155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.576686742724977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1735068821898486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07304680012825625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06753587049767813,0.0,0.08756324449328547,0.05674190406308541,0.08797832638020926,0.0,0.0,0.18315388102926528

Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food and stability as the population increases. They must build a productive economy. And all the while, they must amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!&#10;&#10;Nations is an intense historical board game for 1&ndash;5 players that takes 40 minutes per player to play.

After the growth phase, 2 historical events are revealed, which the players will compete for during the round. Then players take a single small action each, in player order, as many times as they wish until all have passed. Actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Buy a card&#10;     Deploy a worker&#10;     Hire an architect for a wonder&#10;     Special action provided by a card&#10;&#10;&#10;Players each have individual boards that represent their Nation.

At the start of a new round, most old cards are removed and new ones are put on the display.&#10;&#10;Victory points are gained and lost during the game, and also awarded at the end of the game.

The liberal team always has a majority.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, players close their eyes, and the fascists reveal themselves to one another. Secret Hitler keeps his eyes closed, but puts his thumb up so the fascists can see who he is. The fascists learn who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn't know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don't know who anyone is.&#10;&#10;Each round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.&#10;&#10;The objective of the liberal team is to pass five liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler.

(Why you don't already know who your agents are is a question that Congressional investigators will get on your back about later!)&#10;&#10;To set up play, lay out 25 word cards in a 5&times;5 grid. Place a key card in the holder so that each player sees one side of the card. Each player sees a 5&times;5 grid on the card, with nine of the squares colored green (representing your agents) and three squares colored black (representing assassins). Three of the nine squares on each side are also green on the other side, one assassin is black on both sides, one is green on the other side and the other is an innocent bystander on the other side.&#10;&#10;Collectively, you need to reveal all fifteen agents &mdash; without revealing an assassin &mdash; before time runs out in order to win the game. Either player can decide to give the first one-word clue to the other player, along with a number. Whoever receives the clue places a finger on a card to identify that agent. If correct, they can attempt to identify another one. If they identify a bystander, then their guessing time ends. If they identify an assassin, you both lose! Unlike regular Codenames, they can keep guessing as long as they keep identifying an agent each time; this is useful for going back to previous clues and finding ones they missed earlier.

174,254,129437,Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game,2012,7.24927,"Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game is set in the Marvel Comics universe. To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, Red Skull in the base game), stack that particular villain's attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain's particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks &ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine, etc. &ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains &quot;master strike&quot; cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.&#10;&#10;As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins.

Camels don't run neatly, however, sometimes landing on top of another one and being carried toward the finish line. Who's going to run when? That all depends on how the dice come out of the pyramid dice shaker, which releases one die at a time when players pause from their bets long enough to see who's actually moving!&#10;&#10;This 2018 edition of Camel Up features new artwork, a new game board design, a new pyramid design, engraved dice, and new game modes, including crazy rogue camels that start the race running in the opposite direction!

179,261,156129,Deception: Murder in Hong Kong,2014,7.24082,"Deception: Murder in Hong Kong is a game of deduction and deception for 4-12 players that plays in about 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;In the game, players take on the roles of investigators attempting to solve a murder case &ndash; but there's a twist. The killer is one of the investigators! Each player's role and team are randomly assigned at the start of play and include the unique roles of Forensic Scientist, Witness, Investigator, Murderer, and Accomplice. While the Investigators attempt to deduce the truth, the murderer's team must deceive and mislead. This is a battle of wits!&#10;&#10;The Forensic Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence. In order to succeed, the investigators must not only deduce the truth from the clues of the Forensic Scientist, they must also see through the misdirection being injected into the equation by the Murderer and Accomplice!&#10;&#10;Find out who among you can cut through deception to find the truth and who is capable of getting away with murder!&#10;&#10;Roles&#10;&#10;Forensic Scientist x1&#10;As the game master, the Forensic Scientist holds the solution to the crime. They are responsible for assisting the Investigators in identifying the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder.&rdquo; When an Investigator does that successfully, the crime is solved and the Forensic Scientist and the Investigators win the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, the Forensic Scientist is NOT allowed to hint to the solution with words, gestures, or eyes.&#10;&#10;Murderer x1&#10;When the crime takes place, the Murderer chooses 1 Clue card and 1 Means card as the solution to the crime. These will be the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder&rdquo; respectively.&#10;&#10;The Murderer tries to hide their role and look for a scapegoat. Even if they are identified, the Murderer still wins the game if no one correctly identifies both the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Means of Murder&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Investigators x8&#10;To solve the crime, the Investigators must analyze the hints given by the Forensic Scientist. As long as one of the Investigators correctly identifies both the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder,&rdquo; the Murderer is arrested and the Investigators win the game (as does the Forensic Scientist).&#10;&#10;Bear in mind that the Murderer (and sometimes Accomplice) is among the Investigators! The innocent Investigators must make a vigorous effort to defend themselves from false accusation.&#10;&#10;Accomplice x1&#10;The Accomplice is an optional role for games with six or more players. The Accomplice knows who the Murderer is, as well as the solution to the crime. The Accomplice and Murderer both win if the Murderer gets away with his crime.&#10;&#10;Witness x1&#10;The Witness is an optional role when playing with six or more players.* The Witness is an Investigator who has witnessed the culprits leaving the crime scene. They have no way of knowing which is the Murderer and which is the Accomplice and they do not know how the crime was committed.&#10;&#10;If the Murderer is arrested but can identify the Witness, the Witness is considered to be killed, allowing the Murderer and the Accomplice to get away with murder and win the game.&#10;&#10;",4,12,20,20,"['Communication Limits', 'Deduction', 'Events', 'Finale Ending', 'Hidden Roles', 'Storytelling', 'Team-Based Game', 'Traitor Game', 'Variable Set-up']",14,20,1.58,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Bluffing', 'Deduction', 'Murder / Mystery', 'Party Game']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3392,28,193,193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25066299320996266,0.0,0.3692319422049194,0.0,0.0,0.11481419488124502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09687080347274142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20719445409505172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08729116828893677,0.08031039286402392,0.11595435137801555,0.0,0.12533149660498133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12611970920252738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11371336205843201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08226935028316648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12165836987545424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09561883954713353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08107961052599127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07882542798931641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08752850015023325,0.11371336205843201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3900627754264533,0.3736868368290419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10918153100974588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19701627224531187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09078601320429959,0.0,0.0856774895773392,0.0,0.12533149660498133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09026270659428942,0.0,0.21296475123197323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09471107254654547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09052328753767559,0.0,0.0,0.09817388188212642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09441413097922768,0.0,0.09411992623947607,0.0,0.0,0.34916467315574706,0.0,0.0,0.07333979794894001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Will you be able to answer all questions about the case without fail?&#10;&#10;The second edition of MicroMacro: Crime City now marks each case with symbols so that parents can decide which cases the youngest investigators are cleared to research.&#10;&#10;",1,4,15,45,"['Cooperative Game', 'Deduction', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Solo / Solitaire Game']",12,45,1.1029,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Deduction', 'Murder / Mystery']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1119,7,38,121,0.0,0.12554133507946327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11494171172220809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5440822362424584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10195030736639492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.331370967996173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21374216028424672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5048088920161782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1320094042401821,0.0,0.20657034190437815,0.0,0.08404490840779451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11955495627941921,0.0,0.0,0.08404490840779451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1344708132733605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11542448093281742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13281025668837027,0.11399624373923575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13046210785519174,0.0,0.0,0.0791874143945116,0.0,0.11641106185659475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11353318001524722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10763593612086288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10035214247383804,0.13281025668837027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12124297124322121,0.0,0.0,0.0

Equip your survivor with equipment like chainmail armor or shields to defend against the undead, pick up spell books to perform fantastic enchantments, or light up a pool of dragon bile to create an all-consuming inferno of dragon fire!&#10;&#10;Take on the zombie invasion from the medieval streets to secret vaults that create quick passages through the citadel (and often hold special artifacts).

187,270,19857,Glory to Rome,2005,7.22485,"In 64 A.D., a great fire originating from the slums of Rome quickly spreads to destroy much of the city, including the imperial palace. Upon hearing news of the fire, Emperor Nero Caesar races back to Rome from his private estate in Antium and sets up shelters for the displaced population.  Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.&#10;&#10;Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents.  Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leads a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool).  Players who don't follow may 'think' to draw more cards.  There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards.  Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.&#10;&#10;The lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the 'black box' edition, and both have been the source of great controversy.  Many of the non-English editions use more conventional artwork.&#10;&#10;",2,5,60,60,"['End Game Bonuses', 'Follow', 'Hand Management', 'Multi-Use Cards', 'Set Collection', 'Sudden Death Ending', 'Variable Phase Order']",12,60,2.9298,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Ancient', 'Card Game', 'City Building', 'Economic']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1600,15,62,157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11075577765881041,0.0,0.15923578116332177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13056070121447438,0.13101495137847216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1649743752451179,0.0,0.14897517898205992,0.0,0.23427789007388125,0.141902111017595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26868024404081153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13904265890995998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1872503188680914,0.31327183419714494,0.12274963116324293,0.0,0.0,0.12586347999713074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09269757803547596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27698679940787774,0.0,0.10546354322812361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15418758979530478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10032163545918996,0.0,0.3127153491433876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30226081364852675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13795122791143413,0.0,0.1443386040070449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10964266008899942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13101495137847216,0.0,0.0,0.25672063457909045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14497046149193996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15187410289244016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09495916769727607,0.12466858248256457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15835116468044125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The game includes basic rules for two-player games, along with rules for multiplayer formats such as Free-For-All, Hunter, and Hydra.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a ten-card personal deck containing gold (for buying) and weapons (for combat). You start each turn with a new hand of five cards from your personal deck. When your deck runs out of cards, you shuffle your discard pile into your new deck. An 80-card Market deck is shared by all players, with five cards being revealed from that deck to create the Market Row. As you play, you use gold to buy champion cards and action cards from the Market. These champions and actions can generate large amounts of gold, combat, or other powerful effects. You use combat to attack your opponent and their champions.

191,278,9216,Goa: A New Expedition,2004,7.21783,"Goa, a strategy game of auctions and resource management, is set at the start of the 16th century: beautiful beaches, a mild climate, and one of the most important trading centers in the world. Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.&#10;&#10;Each turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.&#10;&#10;After the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand, each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it's not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions, since a player always has at least one action too few.&#10;&#10;The game mixes an interactive element of the auction, which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation, which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.&#10;&#10;The 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant, as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.&#10;&#10;",2,4,90,90,"['Auction / Bidding', 'Auction: Once Around', 'Hand Management', 'Push Your Luck', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks']",12,90,3.3705,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Farming', 'Nautical', 'Renaissance']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2365,22,92,203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22064368739417575,0.13985800696153497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3511551192874967,0.0,0.09542074434636075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10416155170064473,0.0,0.09785632176350177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.070650930007757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10169194071531532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1799409754308827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0867617162268865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1589354147814197,0.0,0.0784664880868693,0.10289801943685575,0.05852741404670065,0.0,0.0,0.20338388143063063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10352226383257918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06888166367869707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07254667649421803,0.1334900701739907,0.09636831517334525,0.0,0.0,0.09153147691769116,0.0,0.0,0.09685510245966122,0.0,0.0,0.13317518304485249,0.08214970273004389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0833033263425234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2057960388737115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0854513677813637,0.19371020491932245,0.09542074434636075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06837310185409458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2745944307530735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0784664880868693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0838995123932046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09589029930809262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08642801166634219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07120556685219355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06566206174999815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10352226383257918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10352226383257918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07120556685219355,0.0,0.0,0.08849626608935932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06362034976317654,0.0,0.0,0.23613981832771982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18638017928828052,0.0,0.3874204098386449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08104416098439986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0838995123932046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14833456363531106,0.09837146732377881

Gather your gun, your mount, and your grit as you forge your path into the history books.&#10;&#10;Western Legends is an open-world sandbox tabletop adventure for 2-6 players set in the American Wild West. Players assume the roles of historical figures of the era, earning their legendary status in a variety of ways: gamble, drive cattle, prospect for gold, rob the bank, fight bandits, pursue stories, become an outlaw, keep the peace. The possibilities are darn near endless.&#10;&#10;Each player's turn starts with drawing poker cards and/or gaining cash. Then they choose three actions. Possible actions include: move on the map (how far depends on whether they have a mount), doing a location-specific action (such as mine for gold if they are at a gold mine, gamble if they're in a saloon, etc.), fight other players at the same location (either duel them, rob them, or arrest them if they're wanted), play poker cards that have action abilities, etc. Legendary Points (LPs) are earned based on the outcomes of many of these actions, and the winner is whoever has the most LPs at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Key Points&#10;- Award-winning gaming experience set in the American West!&#10;- Beautiful artwork, and presentation brings this highly thematic game to life.&#10;- Intuitive gameplay and choices lets you write your own legend every game!&#10;&#10;Note: The Russian edition of Western Legends contains two expansions packaged inside the box and thus has its own entry here: &#208;&#155;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#180;&#209;&#139; &#208;&#180;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#190; &#208;&#183;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#191;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#176; (Western Legends)&#10;&#10;",2,6,60,90,"['Action Points', 'Area Movement', 'Betting and Bluffing', 'Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Dice Rolling', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Hand Management', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Take That', 'Variable Player Powers']",14,90,2.8464,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'American West', 'Miniatures']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1856,13,211,183,0.12444013782628356,0.0,0.0,0.20085714345508413,0.2864610822253807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13885885179206695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11295327898588495,0.0,0.11582004284178267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128437516302416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12553795463332457,0.10156070081012773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13728359568915144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1431255637185476,0.0,0.10851198753019792,0.0,0.10714483727280871,0.0,0.07991832445832915,0.0,0.0,0.2777177035841339,0.0,0.0,0.10518624233135584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1422310693285179,0.0,0.0,0.21165482547321682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13577399466936083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4095627963152157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11756617276245963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13504214791589172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2777177035841339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08649133216565162,0.13432479413408943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10455622328287845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10615230444080723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413581311320418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17932116226259334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1431255637185476,0.0,0.12444013782628356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08687265339399615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14050573457614904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13652093210507188,0.0,0.1413581311320418,0.12133321908158136,0.0,0.11539635167036653,0.128437516302416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10127433424217502,0.0

195,285,31481,Galaxy Trucker,2007,7.2086,"In a galaxy far, far away... they need sewer systems, too. Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.&#10; Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?&#10;&#10;Of course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun.&#10;&#10;Galaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.&#10;&#10;Building happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.&#10;&#10;Once building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, player-on-player combat zones, and other various things.&#10;&#10;Most of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!&#10;&#10;3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components. After the 3rd round the player with the most credits wins!&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,60,"['Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Real-Time', 'Relative Movement', 'Team-Based Game', 'Tile Placement', 'Track Movement']",10,60,2.3298,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Real-time', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration', 'Transportation']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3108,35,120,275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07611821092370306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0886900264927088,0.07147480543957038,0.0,0.0,0.07354383053108285,0.0,0.09031439984218033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18377595872267427,0.32063565943010036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06448938185251218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07222904997713972,0.0,0.0,0.08766752938177982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07736188663749999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08080147501678794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10149365457100512,0.0,0.3690802571486488,0.0,0.06980550551825705,0.0,0.0,0.07704460715937016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08397926401323995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0886900264927088,0.07354383053108285,0.0,0.0,0.17361601343031666,0.08355718983234851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07222904997713972,0.0,0.08397926401323995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07222904997713972,0.0844092278863613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07465259443602239,0.09088238913157486,0.0,0.0,0.09088238913157486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16311143910871456,0.0,0.08766752938177982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22825927996280312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06639148956791836,0.0,0.08273558829944302,0.0,0.0,0.06980550551825705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17527891780879576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08314272100694732,0.17040579776038112,0.07354383053108285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08194232357020832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08314272100694732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11439479803499882,0.07050614031546383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07800988434658705,0.0,0.07867666719144312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07834085980456226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16969476407635445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30817842863748063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06173955678156726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07222904997713972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07552071246095965,0.27299677757491914,0.21407593913172218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1679585280264799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08921884052857396,0.07027021622195952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07274597953975125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05284896467151918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08529404456718308

They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.&#10;&#10;The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.&#10;&#10;Fortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.&#10;&#10;Using those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards).

Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey.

During the game, each player acquires character cards that enlarge his hand, building a crew that gives him more options but it needs to be optimized as he will recycle his cards more slowly. This new &quot;handbuilding&quot; mechanism fits strongly with the historical background.&#10;&#10;Since the aim of the game is to be the first on the Pacific coast, the timing and the opportunistic use of the other players' positions are crucial.&#10;&#10;",1,5,120,120,"['Action Retrieval', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Delayed Purchase', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Race', 'Resource to Move', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Track Movement', 'Worker Placement']",14,120,3.3243,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['American West', 'Exploration']",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1362,15,62,144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20671694582648373,0.0,0.0,0.4734767675824171,0.17766555100017026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2304230677976053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17415234392959497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22253369669102702,0.21648363983444127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22923315690814194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19615501244753117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15679433724203176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37424649931282133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2341351557521936,0.19478202458787278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24376470715204168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2823546281190927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18476567051005072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

201,298,127060,Bora Bora,2013,7.18748,"Stake your fortunes in the mysterious island world of Bora Bora. Journey across islands, building huts where the resilient men and women of your tribes can settle, discovering fishing grounds and collecting shells. Send priests to the temples, and gather offerings to curry favor with the gods.&#10;&#10;In Bora Bora, players use dice to perform a variety of actions using careful insight and tactical planning. The heart of the game is its action resolution system in which 5-7 actions are available each round, the exact number depending on the number of players. Each player rolls three dice at the start of the round, then they take turns placing one die at a time on one action.

204,301,146508,T.I.M.E Stories,2015,7.18286,"The T.I.M.E Agency protects humanity by preventing temporal faults and paradoxes from threatening the fabric of our universe. As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.&#10;&#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of &quot;decksploration&quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &quot;role&quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a &quot;run&quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&rsquo;s obstacles.&#10;&#10;You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time.&#10;&#10;The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &mdash; Asylum &mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers. An insert allows players to &quot;save&quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.&#10;&#10;--description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",2,4,90,90,"['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Move Through Deck', 'Narrative Choice / Paragraph', 'Storytelling', 'Variable Player Powers']",12,90,2.5866,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Puzzle', 'Science Fiction']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2681,31,130,237,0.0,0.1166402111178943,0.0,0.0,0.08335213895504184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10262537471808193,0.23703854182728437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08993434370572267,0.09627985921190231,0.124155753678268,0.0,0.0,0.09825684889524035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24678750419450246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11211514272074734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12192271777468067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11264660960805331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10110115024768097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20683190856309858,0.11057232281586206,0.1198370255593074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07899730803732088,0.0,0.09758402488639609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07046004699524352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12121209156715713,0.0959620521606344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.124155753678268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11373711544650902,0.248311507356536,0.10910128849329148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12121209156715713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12264968163972562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0938225818108208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08149757615375032,0.0,0.0754996540654624,0.0,0.0,0.158365544239764,0.11007433558804071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11373711544650902,0.12264968163972562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07808596151908273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08031899742267007,0.0,0.11159246081347546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000043396468817,0.27798608471596825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09564740742102765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11851927091364219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09660089278584322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10301819387433755,0.08967408268567649,0.35751385330335156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1166402111178943,0.09929371343935817,0.0,0.0,0.10548345752004526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22071861973611337,0.1154468039994711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14292797916766464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000043396468817,0.0,0.09352842587167214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

After three ages of play, whoever has collected the most glory wins!&#10;&#10;In more detail, the land of Ethnos contains twelve tribes of fantasy creatures, and in each game you choose six of them (five in a 2/3-player game), then create a deck with only the creatures in those tribes. The cards come in six colors, which match the six regions of Ethnos. Place three glory tokens in each region at random, arranging them from low to high.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with one card in hand, then 4-12 cards (double the number of players) are placed face up on the table. On a turn, a player either recruits an ally or plays a band of allies. In the former case, you take a face-up card (without replacing it from the deck) or the top card of the deck and add it to your hand. In the latter case, you choose a set of cards in your hand that match either in tribe or in color, play them in front of you on the table, then discard all other cards in hand. You then place one token in the region that matches the color of the top card just played, and you use the power of the tribe member on the top card just played.&#10;&#10;At the end of the first age, whoever has the most tokens in a region scores the glory shown on the first token.

This player secretly chooses one card in his hand, then gives a word or sentence to describe this card&mdash;but not too obviously. Each other player chooses a card in hand that matches this word/sentence and gives it to the storyteller. The storyteller then lays out the cards, and all other players vote on which card belongs to the storyteller. If no one or everyone guesses the storyteller's card, the storyteller receives no points and all players receive two; otherwise the storyteller and the correct guesser(s) each receive three points. Players score one point for each vote their image receives. Players refill their hands, and the next player becomes the storyteller. When the deck runs out, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Dixit Odyssey contains 84 new cards, each with a unique image drawn by Pier&ocirc; and colored by Marie Cardouat, artist of Dixit and Dixit 2. The stand alone version also includes a folding game board, 6 new rabbit scoring tokens (12 total), and a box large enough to hold all the Dixit cards released to date.

209,314,108745,Seasons,2012,7.16898,"The greatest sorcerers of the kingdom have gathered at the heart of the Argos forest, where the legendary tournament of the 12 seasons is taking place. At the end of the three year competition, the new archmage of the kingdom of Xidit will be chosen from among the competitors. Take your place, wizard! Equip your ancestral magical items, summon your most faithful familiars to your side and be ready to face the challenge!&#10;&#10;Seasons is a tactical game of cards and dice which takes place in two phases:&#10;&#10;The first phase &quot;Prelude&quot; consists of a card draft: the goal during this phase will be to establish your own 9-card deck for the main part of the game and with it the strategy.&#10;&#10;Once the Prelude is complete, each player must separate their 9 cards into 3 packs of 3 cards. They will begin the second phase of the game with their first pack of three cards, then gradually as the game progresses, they will receive the other two packets of three cards.&#10;&#10;Next comes the Tournament: at the beginning of each round a player will roll the seasons dice (dice = number of players +1).&#10;&#10;These cubes offer a variety of actions to the players: &#10;- Increase your gauge (maximum number of cards you may have placed on the table and in play) &#10;- Harvesting energy (water, earth, fire, air) to pay the cost of power cards&#10;- Crystallizing the energy (during the current season) to collect crystals. Crystals serve both as a resource to pay for some cards, but also as victory points in the end. &#10;- Draw new cards&#10;&#10;Each player can choose only one die per turn. The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the &quot;time track&quot; would move forward.&#10;In addition, all the dice are different depending on the season. For example, there are not the same energies to a particular season.

210,318,150145,Skull King,2013,7.1606,"Skull King is a trick-taking game similar to Oh Hell!, Wizard, Euchre and Spades, with players needing to state how many tricks they think they'll win each round. A unique element of this game is that bidding takes place simultaneously, leading to rounds that are sometimes over, or under-bid. As players must win the exact number of tricks that they bid to earn points, winning too many tricks is just as bad as winning too few and this leads to intense competition where losing a trick can be as exciting as winning one.&#10;&#10;Skull King uses a 66-card deck that consists of five Escape cards, four suits numbered 1-13, five Pirate cards, 1 Tigress card, and 1 Skull King card. The game lasts ten rounds, and in each round, each player is dealt as many cards as the number of the round. All players simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they'll take by holding out a fist and on the count of three revealing a certain number of fingers (or possibly a closed fist for a bid of zero tricks).&#10;&#10;Standard rules apply for the playing of cards, with one player leading off a card and other players following suit, if possible, and playing something else if not; however, a player may always choose to play one of the special, unnumbered cards &mdash; and the power of those cards might let you win a trick that otherwise would have gotten away. In more detail, the black Jolly Roger suit trumps the other three suits, a Mermaid trumps all numbered cards, a Pirate trumps the Mermaid, and the Skull King trumps everything &mdash; except if he appears in the same trick with a Mermaid, in which case she captures him and wins instead. An Escape card loses to any other card, and the Tigress card serves as either a pirate or escape card as desired by the player. Whoever wins a trick leads in the next trick.&#10;&#10;If a player makes their bid exactly, they score 20 points per trick; if they collect more or fewer tricks, they lose 10 points per trick they are off. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, they win points equal to ten times the current round number &mdash; but if they take even a single trick, they lose this many points instead. If a player catches pirates with the Skull King, or the King with a mermaid, they score bonus points. Whoever has the most points after ten rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",2,8,30,30,"['Hand Management', 'Predictive Bid', 'Rock-Paper-Scissors', 'Trick-taking']",8,30,1.7087,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Nautical', 'Pirates']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2333,15,84,182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09208897260926478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09871656911221854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10052458034367687,0.09120602809380429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08682902062464853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07178000472433205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08039465412229159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08952655047702143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06396136307391981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08993620487326939,0.0,0.0,0.07572670200463069,0.09930516638051778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07769712426991869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1404078940100033,0.0664765474555853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08575461738075979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18241205618760858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18155143580989436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24451773892624193,0.0,0.06351608483228308,0.19233458060494393,0.0891233475999081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07572670200463069,0.31611738803419887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19861033276103557,0.0,0.06322347760683977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1404078940100033,0.0,0.0,0.07502521008106357,0.0834102359349134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25465460848021315,0.2354309006952249,0.0,0.07260597485511203,0.0,0.13743861547919084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09757847714506415,0.0,0.0,0.09443950784760574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07281669911915022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07239697080833188,0.08872639618261104,0.0,0.3015737410310306,0.12279788188335289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09347324775732008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07260597485511203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17150923476151958,0.28005436135854395,0.0,0.2723271537148415,0.17647086193848802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Workers are necessary to found colonies or to acquire buildings and privileges, which exist in five categories and therefore encourage players to follow different strategies competing with each other.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game the player who is most successful in combining their privileges with their achievements (colonies, factories, discoveries, shipyards, and churches) is the winner.&#10;&#10;",2,5,60,90,"['Advantage Token', 'Area Movement', 'Market', 'Rondel']",12,90,3.0828,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Exploration', 'Nautical', 'Renaissance']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1108,8,51,100,0.0,0.0,0.2032677149125972,0.0,0.14749981586875593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18160570399451686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1763352304361192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14902256071712217,0.0,0.5669375184460558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24937197984824272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1234506766214258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15343726219694132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1407839364991537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2108853201764337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14421798441083633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.386130941942219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20534044891197234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1939197993225518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19222399015044822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13419310169571144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16602829531335342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1782539585246027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

215,330,50,Lost Cities,1999,7.13942,"Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in five different colors with three special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30.

216,331,38453,Space Alert,2008,7.13783,"Space Alert is a cooperative team survival game. Players become crew members of a small spaceship scanning dangerous sectors of the galaxy. The missions last just 10 real-time minutes (hyperspace jump, sector scan, hyperspace jump back) and the only task the players have is to protect their ship.&#10;&#10;During play, the central computer will announce the presence of various threats on one of the supplied 10 minute soundtracks that also acts as a game timer. The threats vary from space battleships and interceptors to different interstellar monsters and abominations, asteroids or even intruders and malfunctions on the spaceship. Players have to agree who will take care of which task and coordinate their actions (moving around the ship, firing weapons, distributing energy, using battlebots to deal with intruders, launching guided missiles, etc.) in real time to defend the ship. Only a well-working team can survive 10 minutes and make the jump back to safety.&#10;&#10;The game offers several difficulty levels, huge variability and a unique experience for one to five player teams. One mission lasts only about 30 minutes, including setup and evaluation.&#10;&#10;(Based on a description from Czech Games Edition)&#10;&#10;",1,5,30,30,"['Action Queue', 'Area Movement', 'Cooperative Game', 'Elapsed Real Time Ending', 'Hand Management', 'Real-Time', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game']",12,30,2.9695,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Electronic', 'Real-time', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration']",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1236,10,53,125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11482170278760859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326302782082732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27070735897447107,0.13582460550504066,0.0,0.13927184557898376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16238613550582656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13442683106630238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09706220711207572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13048401986363595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16697566405218986,0.13219248324293736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17103070451385602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11944372684639717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11911985745569599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1598479283270679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14030904296934346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11226695060679524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4980547733037896,0.0,0.1615235284589517,0.0,0.16416435107358873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15095748717584173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15592092559214385,0.0,0.2918027128450493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2906173821144238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20270055911983073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12353049362584309,0.0,0.0,0.13397069881069953,0.0,0.0,0.1330725178685148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12843856276818735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Exploiting the abilities of these specialists lets you collect resources, lay out new landscape tiles (e.g., ponds and pits), and build a variety of buildings, which come in three types:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Processing buildings&#10;    &quot;Immediate&quot; buildings with a one-time effect &#10;    Buildings that provide bonus points at the end of the game for various accomplishments&#10;&#10;&#10;Mastering the balance of knowing the best specialist card to play and being flexible about when you play it &mdash; together with assembling a clever combination of buildings &mdash; is the key to this game.&#10;&#10;The 2021 edition of Glass Road includes previously released promotional material: the Oktoberfest and Adventskalender tiles and the Harlekin card for use in the solitaire version of the game.&#10;&#10;",1,4,20,80,"['Automatic Resource Growth', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Follow', 'Once-Per-Game Abilities', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Tile Placement', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Variable Set-up']",13,80,2.9552,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['City Building', 'Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing', 'Medieval']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1916,15,94,162,0.4072841829045995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11566390864860211,0.0,0.08995063239581368,0.0,0.0,0.10559000712622683,0.0,0.1578744979451324,0.24790062147900105,0.5005113300754428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08310033194919582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09307358602386026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10182104572614988,0.1093334345880088,0.0,0.0,0.1036456613715575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08878810516564713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06539182221405483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08127571630378821,0.07696047362508743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14879468083186442,0.09178465926367568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09307358602386026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1149664495312269,0.19239307930381366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11361891544622194,0.07077007500303766,0.0,0.14706624091059145,0.14844493769504447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08995063239581368,0.0,0.0,0.22857005077154316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07528751677249604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09242211705515463,0.0,0.09656475115558785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07336325956137507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10094919920047168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08381459891781307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07108208467215117,0.0,0.0,0.17589037284788936,0.06896399489790175,0.0,0.10138191702965807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10609669715470203,0.0,0.20096165865126894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1149664495312269,0.09054945366884647,0.09847771454113072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Unfortunately, she has locked herself in the palace, and you must rely on others to take your romantic letters to her. Will yours reach her first?&#10;&#10;Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players. Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!&#10;&#10;Number 4 in the Setting: Tempest Shared World Game Series&#10;&#10;",2,4,20,20,"['Deduction', 'Hand Management', 'Player Elimination', 'Score-and-Reset Game', 'Take That']",10,20,1.1846,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Deduction', 'Renaissance']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,888,9,47,100,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16654019730629324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19474994185330838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16772011747926183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20932858395191037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16732448575756947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2232846551755356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23747883385022772,0.0,0.2485126469057873,0.0,0.17181120154395757,0.0,0.15916652854396957,0.0,0.16538079852780446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19969025714055488,0.0,0.0,0.1646189188129795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.470513006164489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22801456392480576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24985943512443506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21158858849848378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22900219309153533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22237765139590587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18637109416994518,0.0
225,348,5,Acquire,1963,7.12424,"In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.&#10;&#10;History of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;Many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of &quot;Vacations&quot; from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called &quot;ACQUIRE.&quot; 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had developed some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.&#10;&#10;December 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition&#10;1964 - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs&#10;1965 - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs (last edition made with printed backs until 1999)&#10;1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)&#10;1968 - Dated 1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of mixed parts)&#10;1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board&#10;1975 - 3M sells rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company&#10;1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82,       &amp; 86)&#10;1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions (This edition was also produced in 1992)&#10;1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions&#10;1997 - Avalon Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro&#10;1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks &amp; money, large info cards&#10;2006 - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast&#10;2006 - Lloyd's (private) Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of the game of ACQUIRE back to the  intentions of Sid Sackson's original ideas.

It looks at first sight to be similar to previous modern editions, but has been criticised for the use of inferior design choices such as hard-to-read grey-on-grey embossed slots and the unusual tile fonts. It contains modified rules and a slightly smaller playing grid. Although these changes have been criticised for not ultimately improving upon Sackson's original design, they are generally regarded as not being too damaging to it.&#10;2023 - Renegade Game Studio partners with Hasbro, and releases their new version, with Classic Mode or Tycoon Mode &mdash; play with or without tertiary stockholder merger bonus.&#10;&#10;",2,6,90,90,"['Hand Management', 'Investment', 'Market', 'Square Grid', 'Stock Holding', 'Tile Placement', 'Victory Points as a Resource']",12,90,2.494,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Territory Building']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,4532,24,205,312,0.0,0.0,0.47834044822537786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31757024651819843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03719748500113746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04671366214649611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04264507378810849,0.29710711982441584,0.0,0.0,0.04042871704201258,0.0,0.0,0.0923135336969124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0441569473514589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04536717807402835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02667433945576055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35859220009038945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13094462235032905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043705154485242245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07413890146321679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045887742266526504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1891909343886205,0.0385593028660022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09124926158834001,0.0,0.0,0.05716440698572303,0.044389403006582194,0.029698126110904183,0.02997653610302655,0.0,0.0,0.16521163004772765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24673732636365206,0.0,0.039933290891033986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032825160384855404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04326979414060045,0.03620961839245086,0.0923135336969124,0.04326979414060045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27158618524374795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03799585345332414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04562463079417001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03404680120209729,0.0,0.032130989699592626,0.0,0.0,0.039933290891033986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11790926404480381,0.3551878692341269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04671366214649611,0.0,0.0,0.039933290891033986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027054405983447084,0.07103757384682538,0.0,0.04059852258536042,0.0,0.0,0.11931780811617243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04264507378810849,0.0,0.0334674418515139,0.0

228,351,93260,Summoner Wars: Master Set,2011,7.12208,"Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed card game for 2-4 players in which they take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia. These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens. But most notoriously, they summon their great race's hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy. A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.&#10;&#10;The Summoner Wars Master Set contains six new and different complete factions from which to choose:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Play as the Shadow Elves and conceal your plans in swirling darkness!&#10;     Choose the Benders and confound your foe, turning his own troops against him!&#10;     Command the Vargath, mountainous goatfolk who call lightning from the heavens!&#10;     Select the nefarious Sand Goblins and delight in malicious trickery!&#10;     Muster the Deep Dwarves and control the forces of Geomancy!&#10;     Lead the ferocious Swamp Orcs to war and hack upon your foes as they are snared in your vines! &#10;&#10;&#10;Strategy shapes the composition of each deck of cards and how they are used. Tactics determine the effectiveness of those cards in battle. Call walls of stone to protect you in combat and serve as magic portals for you to summon your warriors. Call your forces forth and send them in a surging wave against your enemy.

Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!&#10;&#10;On each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go &quot;into decline&quot;. A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depending on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;Clarifications: available in a pinned forum post.&#10;&#10;",2,5,40,80,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hidden Victory Points', 'Increase Value of Unchosen Resources', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up', 'Victory Points as a Resource']",8,80,2.3482,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Territory Building']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1531,11,78,154,0.10434063641480976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1005122615621559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09571609741144431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11925798661854231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1052611344656351,0.0,0.1200080027753507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1005122615621559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06768049883113429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08983886312640202,0.0,0.06700996142280116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09217648633600116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08873422826391482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11852604491096994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10925034877643051,0.0,0.10479739857175976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1200080027753507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07535271840074961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1178113269696912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07715052775298127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09605931135748515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10978795769669532,0.0,0.0,0.6587277461801719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09895427334257019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07552778580784615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08152559557896885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10344721579929216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32616627015610816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17277312473166215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18024283006822062,0.07067052853403112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1151096261522623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11146034948295952,0.0,0.08613656827110368,0.13728967463854413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08068181601400189,0.0,0.0,0.08983886312640202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1076923605568448,0.06978578313772132,0.0,0.0,0.25474968137851406,0.0

239,371,172818,Above and Below,2015,7.09923,"Your last village was ransacked by barbarians. You barely had time to pick up the baby and your favorite fishing pole before they started the burning and pillaging. You wandered over a cruel desert, braved frozen peaks, and even paddled a log across a rough sea, kicking at the sharks whenever they got too close, the baby strapped tightly to your back.&#10;&#10;Then you found it! The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface.&#10;&#10;With any luck, you'll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.&#10;&#10;Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?&#10;&#10;A great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You'll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you're willing to sacrifice to succeed. The book of paragraphs is packed with encounters of amazing adventure, randomly chosen each time you visit the cavern.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most well-developed village wins!&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter version of the game included the following items which are not found in the Retail version:&#10;&#10;     Villager Tool tokens&#10;     Lost Villagers&#10;     Swamp Villagers&#10;     Exclusive Stretch goals:&#10;     Creature Villagers&#10;     Quest Tokens&#10;     Underforest Tokens and PDF story book&#10;     Desert Labyrinth tokens and PDF story book &#10;     Wooden Goods&#10;&#10;&#10;This collection of items can be found in Above and Below: Expanded Edition Exclusives&#10;&#10;",2,4,90,90,"['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Narrative Choice / Paragraph', 'Set Collection', 'Storytelling', 'Trading', 'Turn Order: Progressive']",13,90,2.5217,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'City Building', 'Economic', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Farming', 'Negotiation']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2716,20,136,231,0.09919830946333878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22138457241219744,0.0,0.0,0.09555861234796525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11134123829109073,0.08972929267205472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1752673154196715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1538079204730504,0.16101008319875837,0.0,0.11069228620609872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11409352488573438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09919830946333878,0.10651719201667553,0.10596713438613035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10882859749068825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08650107519592426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06370744054041376,0.0,0.09266848705497471,0.0,0.2629009731295073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22818704977146875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2267609450939047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09518112785537719,0.11268460387572597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11069228620609872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10287018885383098,0.2240102202283913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18602865069980454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0856798686015947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10764977453058702,0.0,0.07442453065597106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08541124199030133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07130900464958818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18008296228958445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07750768576180245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06925113155458779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.268750400623836,0.0,0.0,0.4453649531643629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0818914111420367,0.06526174316578337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08821705436945464,0.19188219356078712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17029018247105113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.066346458577423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Players try to have the most points at the end of the game by creating beautiful garden paths for their visitors.&#10;&#10;The deck has 80 cards in ten different colors, with each color featuring a different species of tree; each color has cards numbered 1 through 8, and the number of colors used depends on the number of players. Players start with a hand of seven cards. On each turn, a player draws two cards (from the deck or one or more of the discard piles), lays a card on the table as part of her arboretum, then discards a card to her personal discard pile.&#10;&#10;When the deck is exhausted, players compare the cards that remain in their hands to determine who can score each color. For each color, the player(s) with the highest value of cards in hand of that color scores for a path of trees in her arboretum that begins and ends with that color; a path is a orthogonally adjacent chain of cards with increasing values. For each card in a path that scores, the player earns one point; if the path consists solely of trees of the color being scored, the player scores two points per card. If a player doesn't have the most value for a color, she scores zero points for a path that begins and ends with that color.

242,374,25292,Merchants & Marauders,2010,7.09802,"Merchants &amp; Marauders lets you live the life of an influential merchant or a dreaded pirate in the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy. Seek your fortune through trade, rumor hunting, missions, and of course, plundering.  Modify your ship, buy impressive vessels, load deadly special ammunition, and hire specialist crew members. Will your captain gain eternal glory and immense wealth - or find his wet grave under the stormy surface of the Caribbean Sea?&#10;&#10;In Merchants and Marauders, players take on the role of a captain of a small vessel in the Caribbean.  The goal is to be the first to achieve 10 &quot;glory&quot; points through performing daring deeds (through the completion of missions or rumors), crushing your enemies (through defeating opponents and NPCs in combat), amassing gold, performing an epic plunder or pulling off the trade of a lifetime, and buying a grand ship.  While some points earned from performing various tasks are permanent, players earn points for amassing gold, which can be stolen or lost (or at least diminished) if their captain is killed.  Points due to gold are hidden so there's some uncertainty about when the game will end.&#10;&#10;A big component of the game is whether (or when) to turn &quot;pirate&quot; or remain as a trader or neutral party. Both careers are fraught with danger: pirates are hunted by NPCs (and other players) for their bounty and blocked to certain ports while traders are hunted by non-player pirates as well as their opponents and generally have to sacrifice combat capability for cargo capacity.  Although players can kill each other, there is no player elimination as players may draw a new captain (with a penalty) so it's possible to come back from defeat.&#10;&#10;",2,4,180,180,"['Action Points', 'Area Movement', 'Bias', 'Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Race', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up']",13,180,3.2488,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Fighting', 'Nautical', 'Pike and Shot', 'Pirates', 'Transportation']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1758,11,71,172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1630670195625202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13370201259728554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16493812671454824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14592664471732578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32798480655356593,0.14781141393781858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14471448894676378,0.0,0.0,0.16894368513706104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1257030069495413,0.0,0.15114864271589645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09492789661015578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1396464398933397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1375723668731483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13511291553075053,0.4864833571961242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1547666286186459,0.0,0.0,0.1604046023519591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1067464435102122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28254071310059375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12608891701853636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13144868708269242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15401828481262086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12237724789944505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33581359839705166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13144868708269242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12687127828563302,0.16790679919852583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Each player leads one of four armies: Borgo, Hegemonia (Hegemony), Moloch, and Posterunek (Outpost). Each army deck consists of 34 tiles: soldiers, support tiles, and special actions. You win when all enemy headquarters are destroyed or when your headquarters is the least damaged at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The second edition of Neuroshima Hex!, released at Spiel 2007, had updated graphics and a new, larger board; a special expansion pack sold at the same time included the Neuroshima Hex! Doomsday Machine 1.0, a fifth army that could be used against any of the other ones.&#10;&#10;The first French edition of Neuroshima Hex!, released in 2008, included an additional four Mercenary tiles. The first English edition from Z-Man Games that same year includes the Mercenary tiles and the Mad Bomber tile.&#10;&#10;Neuroshima Hex! 3.0, released in 2013 from Z-Man Games, includes rule corrections, the Doomsday Machine army (for five armies in the NH base game), a solo variant with 55 puzzle cards that present you with challenging situations, and new three-player variants: Deathmatch; Deathmatch with scores; one player vs. a team; and a team match (with one player playing two armies).&#10;&#10; The game is also expanded by Unofficial Neuroshima Hex! expansions, available here on BGG.&#10;&#10;Note:  All base game and expansion armies in all versions/editions are functionally compatible!  The only differences between armies from e.g. 3.0 and 2.5 (or whatever) are art &amp; graphic design.&#10;&#10;Note:  There is no solitaire bot/AI/system to compete against.

245,384,219513,Bärenpark,2017,7.09103,"Up to two thousand pounds in weight and over ten feet tall, the bear is considered the biggest and heaviest terrestrial carnivore in the world. Of course, there is not just &quot;one bear;&quot; on the contrary, there are plenty of subspecies that differ from each other in various aspects. For instance, only the Kodiak bear (ursus arctos middendorffi) weighs about 2,000 lbs. The polar bear (ursus maritimus) weighs &quot;only&quot; 1,100 lbs., but gets much bigger than the Kodiak bear, being as much as 11 ft. tall!&#10;&#10;B&auml;renpark takes you into the world of bears, challenging you to build your own bear park. Would you like another polar bear enclosure or rather a koala* house? The park visitors are sure to get hungry on their tour through the park, so build them places to eat! Whatever your choices are, make sure you get the next building permit and use your land wisely! (* No, koalas aren't bears but they're so cute, we couldn't leave them out of this game!)&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player in B&auml;renpark builds their own bear park, attempting to make it as beautiful as they can, while also using every square meter possible. The park is created by combining polyomino tiles onto a grid, with players scoring for animal houses, outdoor areas, completed construction, and more. The sooner you build it, the better! Cover icons to get new tiles and park sections. The game ends as soon as one player has finished expanding their park, then players tally their points to see who has won.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,45,"['Grid Coverage', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection', 'Tile Placement']",8,45,1.6563,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Animals', 'Puzzle']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1574,16,88,171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12722148748809628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1649997158805069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3573826351090614,0.12470577508996313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15044293658258057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13804275752259412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12541022984287498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12988715833839756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3376249472896988,0.16249072453299315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16586832477108263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13272180488694335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23057360375877786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11201227070144658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32178596993062775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13230569070197298,0.0,0.0,0.17146711651308585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16414765293142305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13108008109515654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13530321059883177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15433512534879656,0.0,0.0,0.1529997440247739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12648816037097715,0.0,0.0,0.17563123287850105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2654436097738867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10109324960927514,0.0,0.13757435583627184,0.0,0.0,0.13665201486438452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2501132314602692,0.0

The strategy and tactical decisions involved in Civilization: The Board Game will appeal to strategy gamers and war gamers alike, and the ability to win through culture and technological advancement will give those who only wish to focus on their own empire a chance at victory as well.&#10;&#10;",2,4,120,240,"['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Modular Board', 'Open Drafting', 'Rock-Paper-Scissors', 'Square Grid', 'Tech Trees / Tech Tracks', 'Trading', 'Variable Player Powers']",13,240,3.8959,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,"['City Building', 'Civilization', 'Exploration', 'Negotiation', 'Video Game Theme']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2818,24,127,221,0.10651494356649432,0.11437364969118462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10260679094836507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09913654503005359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08257621555194697,0.0,0.1047169289947395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11437364969118462,0.09913654503005359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06909086201938515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09003450865295921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12250879506165106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20126230130994222,0.0,0.08050831187762571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16958389635086704,0.0,0.0,0.1115269671950135,0.0,0.10698122398266335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2044029281740454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11817518765978802,0.11497574750959118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12026634372616643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3267593899577074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10605557126294274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12099595535014213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4040653460783871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1968308360629691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11437364969118462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08322447045268523,0.0,0.0,0.20686738995042397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10745462345829546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11885668901289365,0.0,0.0,0.0721431995937896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08793152911137361,0.0,0.0,0.0953630804570801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24708932324531743,0.0,0.11685553899913437,0.18342194881664534,0.0,0.2742755789986857,0.0,0.0,0.08479194817543352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26005829433261374,0.0
247,386,176920,Mission: Red Planet (Second Edition),2015,7.0906,"With technology rapidly developing and the human population growing, Victorian-era Earth is in dire need of fuel, land, and other natural resources. Fortunately, automated probes sent to Mars have discovered celerium, an ore that can be combusted to produce ten thousand times more power than a steam engine, and sylvanite, the densest substance ever found. More incredibly, the probes found ice that could be used in terraforming the planet, bringing the idea of colonizing Mars even closer to becoming a reality.&#10;&#10;As the head of a mining corporation, these minerals and ice found on Mars could make you unfathomably wealthy &ndash; if you can reach them before your competitors. You have ten rounds to send your astronauts into space, occupy the planet's most resource-rich zones, and harvest as much celerium, sylvanite, and ice as possible. At your command is a team of nine professionals. Each has a unique skill set, from helping your astronauts traverse the Red Planet to blowing up spaceships before they launch.&#10;&#10;In each round in Mission: Red Planet, players start by secretly deploying one of their character cards, with this card determining both when they place astronauts on the spaceships awaiting launch to Mars and which special action they take during the round. Each spaceship has a specified destination, and until an astronaut sets foot in a region, no one knows which resource they'll find. Players collect resources (worth points) three times during the game, and they each have a secret mission card that might grant them additional points at game's end. During the game, players might acquire an additional mission or a research card that changes the value of what awaits on Mars.&#10;&#10;The 2015 edition of Mission: Red Planet features the same gameplay as the original 2005 edition, but it includes:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Components for up to six players instead of five&#10;    Special two-player variant rules&#10;    New action cards and revised mission and discovery cards&#10;    Mars' moon Phobos as a new zone that astronauts can explore before possibly returning to the planet itself&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,6,45,90,"['Action Retrieval', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Take That', 'Turn Order: Role Order']",14,90,2.2035,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Science Fiction'],False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2146,11,92,198,0.0,0.0,0.12678464413088011,0.19352302213769665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24866868677491738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12433434338745869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10959600742482062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2630719815243899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20909953615573448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07700017737639182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10591866712207328,0.13378854337525983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1378994600815314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12807747532447006,0.0,0.11327334772756796,0.09570378007358683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13081632708770427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10959600742482062,0.0,0.0,0.12433434338745869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12942004283091854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08995341851834603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24299036228022222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125537995480108,0.0,0.10454976807786724,0.10591866712207328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11989631602402602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08618782923902062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10227624673383688,0.1137069241310922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13081632708770427,0.2176577793918391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17357577233498955,0.10698176813836886,0.0,0.0989782846407049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12493098102113294,0.0,0.0,0.08638670414543065,0.1261557541139077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10770892884900525,0.0,0.0,0.11690284367513004,0.0,0.19853109847761705,0.0,0.09367988261758016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11642797306219226,0.27407525472935146,0.0837005751288415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2548501481118467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0989782846407049,0.0,0.10355721441553754,0.0,0.11836749710488878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12942004283091854

The game board represents the Whitechapel area at the time of Jack the Ripper and is marked with 199 numbered circles linked together by dotted lines. During play, Jack the Ripper, the Policemen, and the Wretched are moved along the dotted lines that represent Whitechapel's streets.

249,388,318084,Furnace,2020,7.08707,"Furnace is an engine-building Eurogame in which players take on the roles of 19th-century capitalists building their industrial corporations and aspiring to make as much money as they can by purchasing companies, extracting resources, and processing them in the best combinations possible.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a random start-up card, the resources depicted at the top of that card, and four colored discs valued 1-4.&#10;&#10;The game is played over four rounds, and each round consists of two phases: Auction and Production. During the auction, 6-8 company cards are laid out with their basic sides face up. Players take turns placing one of their discs on one of these cards, but you cannot place a disc on a card if a disc of the same value or color is already present. Thus, you'll place discs on four cards.&#10;&#10;Once all the discs are placed, the cards are resolved from left to right. Whoever placed the highest-valued disc will claim this card, but first anyone with a lower-valued disc on this card will gain compensation, either the resources depicted multiplied by the value of their disc or a processing ability (exchange X for Y) up to as many times as the value of their disc.&#10;&#10;Once all the cards have been claimed or discarded, players enter the production phase, using their cards in the order of their choice. Each company card has one action &mdash; either production or processing &mdash; on its basic side and two actions on its upgraded side. During the production phase, you can use each of your cards once to gain resources, process those resources into other resources or money, and upgrade your cards.&#10;&#10;At the end of four rounds, whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;Furnace also includes capitalist cards that contain unique effects, and if you want, you can choose to deal one out to each player at the start of the game. For an additional challenge, you can require players to create a &quot;production chain&quot;, with each newly acquired company card being placed somewhere in that chain and locked in position for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,60,"['Action Queue', 'Auction / Bidding', 'Auction Compensation', 'Auction: Fixed Placement', 'Auction: Multiple Lot', 'Constrained Bidding', 'Multi-Use Cards', 'Open Drafting', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up']",12,60,2.3176,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing', 'Post-Napoleonic']",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2129,14,96,172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07303621084542827,0.06944249576432938,0.0,0.0,0.09384836200535367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10218214078893542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07994809112571818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14688932471991334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10280204221249642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07385954644562273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10408739932574228,0.0,0.09010821297532452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0921202281675593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09254175067960886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15584116733803685,0.0,0.05812022908567487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07696249281356042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27360976991833913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.168459172994474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09254175067960886,0.0,0.0,0.08272377123586803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09667370206416381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06789741880424281,0.0,0.062900418314125,0.0,0.0,0.13193780955060086,0.0,0.0,0.27268403159388854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0947568863457882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06691551900458544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13011025559805367,0.252688759491711,0.0,0.09384836200535367,0.0,0.06874458488545028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07719876879161745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10157649124289997,0.0,0.4928684750437294,0.0,0.08582671760380571,0.0,0.10280204221249642,0.0,0.06550805462771304,0.16150105321962346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17944722703524205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1414203557438097,0.09049851040968339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09618126539095499,0.0,0.0,0.09254175067960886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07696249281356042,0.0,0.0,0.07470944579393472,0.059538217689339486,0.0,0.0810235300369561,0.2680336441722284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0833158095209634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17647803645835644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06052780238592237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

And has it ever occurred to you how hard it actually is to build and manage such underground complex filled with corridors and creatures? No? Well now you can try. Put yourself in role of the master of underground, summon your servants, dig complex of tunnels and rooms, set traps, hire creatures and try to stop filthy heroes from conquering and plundering your precious creation. We can guarantee you will look on dark corners, lairs and their inhabitant from completely different perspective!&#10;&#10;Each turn, players use a hand of cards to choose where to place their worker.  Actions vary from mining gold, hiring monsters, buying traps etc.  Each action has three spots available - with each spot having different effects (e.g. mining gold lets you mine more gold in each spot).&#10;When using the cards, two cards will become locked and will not be able to be used next turn.&#10;&#10;There are 4 turns to place actions for each game &quot;year&quot; and two game years in a whole game.&#10;Each turn is identified as a &quot;season&quot;.  Each season, players will get to see the heroes and events to come in the following season.  Thus allowing them to prepare.&#10;&#10;At the end of each season (after the first), heroes will be allocated to each player according to their level of evil.  Heroes range from mighty heroes to sneaky thieves.  Each hero has their own power for which the player needs to prepare for.&#10;Finally, at the end of each year, the heroes will travel down into the dungeon to fight.&#10;&#10;Scoring in the game is based upon what you have built, the monsters you have hired and the heroes you have captured.&#10;&#10;",2,4,90,90,"['Action Queue', 'Hand Management', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Tile Placement', 'Worker Placement']",12,90,3.5705,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Humor']",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2016,23,109,184,0.0,0.12664567927690162,0.0,0.09518570752376285,0.18100427212831915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10819481315172977,0.0,0.0,0.10705656360989424,0.0,0.10977366832654271,0.0,0.0,0.10419373528401078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27430936073813744,0.0,0.0,0.13160973840814277,0.13160973840814277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09625873391336938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11794375205777173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11547261032686221,0.0,0.0,0.13480590964317685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15300830525033302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1514923915938455,0.0,0.0,0.13160973840814277,0.0,0.26321947681628555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10977366832654271,0.0,0.0,0.08638144326926794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38818160879991137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08617767976351488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13397854310368731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38193714241971977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10155135105375396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16956844545795033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11185515711993989,0.0,0.0,0.10385210012751983,0.13238132256339452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10488737604609304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11846006329028629,0.0,0.0,0.11743509016247182,0.0,0.08497985887051797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08233747464026113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13480590964317685,0.2126363369713815,0.11453189257862087,0.1003027025423762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07759421401881682,0.10187073986803827,0.10559531968276077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10123490595704732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Only by working together will players be able to defeat all of the villains, securing the castle from the forces of evil.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,60,"['Cooperative Game', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Variable Player Powers']",11,60,2.0771,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Novel-based']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,892,6,42,90,0.0,0.22066083931001387,0.21730546300763956,0.0,0.0,0.20036832335554464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19414746512167885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18588305471486496,0.0,0.21516874081923137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16677411140565504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2073119767015402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2230070953779398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44834312612297744,0.2348787999373826,0.1846102011330977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15532451502873126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23202960138997766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14979857107088337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19489060339179742,0.0,0.0,0.18094649346971992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18652978384011626,0.0,0.0,0.18275030434123282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14806448265649652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2046127882739732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17749427448894617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

255,398,181304,Mysterium,2015,7.07354,"In the 1920s, Mr. MacDowell, a gifted astrologer, immediately detected a supernatural being upon entering his new house in Scotland. He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.&#10;&#10;Unable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.&#10;&#10;In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.&#10;&#10;Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.&#10;&#10;After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.&#10;&#10;If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.&#10;&#10;Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.&#10;&#10;If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...&#10;&#10;",2,7,42,42,"['Communication Limits', 'Cooperative Game', 'Deduction', 'Finale Ending', 'Hand Management', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Storytelling', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Voting']",10,42,1.8939,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Deduction', 'Horror', 'Murder / Mystery', 'Party Game']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3586,30,133,247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08977548802184006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09774759367584634,0.05559790089687396,0.0,0.08087239600023446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08440958110319087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14724487895314775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19668118466984402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29502177700476606,0.06325463673264885,0.07803780682071858,0.0,0.0,0.08440958110319087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08178890719211972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5796113018821757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09604798705976306,0.06495077568030899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06251985348150646,0.12621191236414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14547618658506686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07453895066845911,0.1866955071463359,0.09716822838482042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866955071463359,0.16114830503351513,0.09247821268519504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07970003205013286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09716822838482042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0821019705997081,0.07698760152098283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0676414653481032,0.0,0.0,0.08546713264411705,0.09020628962722099,0.08619765568390193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18218127162252284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0676414653481032,0.0,0.09894788148501023,0.0,0.09295825158443823,0.15826737462468343,0.0712614453392957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060435916378180514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1759051770067645,0.0,0.0,0.19433645676964084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07803780682071858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05695435098490146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14861335832083947,0.19668118466984402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
256,399,37046,Ghost Stories,2008,7.07166,"Ghost Stories is a cooperative game in which the players protect the village from incarnations of the lord of hell &ndash; Wu-Feng &ndash; and his legions of ghosts before they haunt a town and recover the ashes that will allow him to return to life. Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.&#10;&#10;The players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts that appear during the course of the game. At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time. The ghosts all have abilities of their own &ndash; some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile's special action. On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted. Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles.&#10;&#10;To exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds. The white result is a wild color that can be used as any color. For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both. If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll. You may choose to use these after your roll. Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts.

The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.&#10;&#10;Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players&rsquo; identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission.

A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.&#10;&#10;In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.&#10;&#10;Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked. Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings.&#10;&#10;",2,4,45,60,"['Action Drafting', 'Follow', 'Hand Management', 'Multi-Use Cards', 'Set Collection', 'Variable Phase Order']",10,60,2.2851,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'City Building', 'Economic']",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1195,9,52,119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11237938048775727,0.0,0.0,0.11119710774634067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09497287076819469,0.19884008283814336,0.6021871611688995,0.13669990674803822,0.0,0.0,0.1391603278756986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12470064679535527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17818230017200404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07946304472747812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10547897433041753,0.13832118418266723,0.0,0.09998165871916732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1391603278756986,0.10418203280366607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12954359612961788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17902141482724682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11198091867185027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13086456053468654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08514658510400883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12304165178818514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27664236836533446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128901020879854,0.0,0.1375013328685285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10894402418826044,0.1391603278756986,0.0,0.17735294288508957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128901020879854,0.0,0.0,0.13591609582252862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10142566008942146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21162143179904533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1894555408230978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Chaos, Dwarf, Wood Elf, Human, Orc, and Skaven teams compete against each other over the course of a brutal season. Customize your team by drafting Star Players, hiring staff, upgrading facilities, and cheating like mad. Lead your gang of misfits and miscreants to glory over your rivals all to become Spike! Magazine's Manager of the Year!&#10;&#10;Once a manager has chosen one of the six teams, he has five weeks to groom them into the best in the league, culminating with the Blood Bowl tournament. He does this by competing at highlights, collecting payouts, upgrading his personnel, and drafting Star Players.&#10;&#10;Managers begin the season with a starting team deck full of basic scrub players. These players are none too bright and have limited talents, but a clever manager can play to their strengths by carefully positioning them to excel on the pitch.&#10;&#10;Is your team ready to compete against other teams in head-to-head highlights? Highlights are the randomly determined matchups over which players compete. The more highlights a team wins, the more it improves and the more fans it accumulates.&#10;&#10;The season culminates with the Blood Bowl tournament. After the Blood Bowl, the season ends. Players then tally up their total fans and the manager with the most fans wins the game.&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,120,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting']",14,120,2.3443,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Sports']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1519,15,75,138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13307581613564576,0.0,0.0,0.12631140573616523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16444952647564512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16444952647564512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4582094844356694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13998449805694446,0.0,0.10398132181316722,0.0,0.12844635023186787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11669200611571683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11412982549551297,0.10807023086764064,0.0,0.1614393747548683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12349529768791884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12589725015620024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12844635023186787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6942204497130202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15773717648616833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19125789491244694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

262,414,234487,Altiplano,2017,7.05979,"Altiplano is a bag-building game along the lines of Orl&eacute;ans, set in the South American highlands of the Andes (the &quot;Altiplano&quot;). The competition for limited resources is considerable, as it was in Orl&eacute;ans, but the greater focus in Altiplano is on building up your own production to be the best that it can be - or at least better than that of the other players!&#10;&#10;The object of the game is for players to use their goods to produce more goods that will be worth points in the end. Each player starts with a unique role tile, giving them access to different goods and methods of production. Players have limited access to production at the start, but they can acquire additional production sites during the game that open up new options. The various types of goods &mdash; such as fish, alpaca, cacao, silver and corn &mdash; all have their own characteristics and places where they can be used. For example, silver can be sold for a high price at the market, fish can be exchanged for other goods at the harbor and alpaca can produce wool at the farm that can then be made into cloth.&#10;&#10;Aside from building up an effective production, players must fulfill their orders at the right time, develop the road in good time and store their goods cleverly enough to fill their warehouses in the most valuable way. Often, a good warehouse keeper is more relevant in the end than the best producer.&#10;&#10;",2,5,60,120,"['Action Points', 'Contracts', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Modular Board', 'Open Drafting', 'Tile Placement', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up', 'Worker Placement']",12,120,3.2853,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Economic'],False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1437,9,56,134,0.0,0.0,0.16349043000739946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16033073566952777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14893510732325174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27316696832342413,0.16601485763530743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37641903903981366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10028629542747693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19858543905233333,0.0,0.1444306350406092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1756272214460083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32863254527294167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16431627263647083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16188286053098494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17153284002335703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22540282660092834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16515755246703115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14033625361795793,0.0,0.1466265417901912,0.1374927506524808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11139676657591777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12080141406068376,0.15460784227809152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14776602443764153,0.0,0.2094336071683768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1611001075753818,0.1276337716466586,0.10171521418817883,0.13353836051065604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1374927506524808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13311968623107173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1668888105420756

Players are builders who try to contribute the most to this cathedral's construction and, in so doing, score the most victory points.  Gameplay roughly consists of using workers to produce raw materials, and then using craftsmen to convert the materials into victory points.  Workers may also be used to produce gold, the currency of the game.  Players are also given three master builders each turn, each of which can do a variety of tasks, including recruiting more workers, buying or selling goods, or just obtaining victory points.  Getting early choices with a master builder costs gold, as does purchasing better craftsmen.

In the shadow of the Notre Dame cathedral, the players compete for prosperity and reputation. Each family controls one of the 3&ndash;5 boroughs that surround the site of Notre Dame. As head of his family, each player tries, through clever use of his action cards, to advance the power and prestige of his family, but penalties are assessed on those who do not take care of the health of the people who live in their borough. The player with the most prestige at the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players play as well-off Parisians in the 14th century who wish to improve the importance and appearance of the city quarter around the famous Notre Dame cathedral. The primary game concept is original, but simple, card play players use to permanently improve their influence in the quarter.

267,427,250458,Gùgōng,2018,7.04563,"China, 1570. China is under the reign of the Longqing Emperor, of the Ming Dynasty. He inherited a country in disarray after years of mismanagement and corruption. He resided in the Forbidden city, which was the seat of many emperors under the Ming Dynasty. Constructed from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 72 ha (over 180 acres). It is also under the Ming Dynasty that the Great Wall of China was rebuilt, fortified, and expanded. Around this period, China was under heavy attack from the Mongols, so maintaining the Great Wall was essential. Most of what we now have left of the Great Wall, we owe to the Ming dynasty.&#10;&#10;The country was already famous for its very intricate bureaucracy, but this also led to a lot of corruption. Even though the penalties for corruption were very high, the highest Officials of the Forbidden City would pretend to uphold the ban on corruption, by accepting gifts of petitioners, and returning one of seemingly lower value.&#10;&#10;G&ugrave;g&#197;&#141;ng uses this extraordinary custom as its basis. Players take on the role of powerful Chinese families trying to gain influence and power by exchanging gifts with Officials. The gift cards you offer as a player have to be of a higher value than the one you receive, forcing you to make strategic choices regarding which actions you want to take each turn. You will travel around China, sail down the Grand Canal, purchase precious jade, help construct the Great Wall, secure advantages through decrees, influence the game through intrigue, and ultimately, receive an audience with the emperor. If only 1 player succeeds in doing so, he wins. If several players succeed, the player with the most VPs among those players wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",1,5,60,90,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Hand Management', 'Set Collection', 'Worker Placement']",12,90,3.0735,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Medieval', 'Travel']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1817,16,75,175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11398604996440634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16772638248725644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26333003520433523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14604078864701683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27651649755039764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15121030451261072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13344849545406645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13123040883412623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13825824877519882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5701306392168302,0.0,0.0,0.13390609981340948,0.15787627448903938,0.15190221060830558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15868458229276786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11144989083543466,0.0,0.10324758846612217,0.0,0.0,0.10828434077792935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14087985193201627,0.14790769187308883,0.0,0.13080012460315768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1321040387173812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14985884426009127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14425115911882572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2933083555487769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13675833396183537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19870613897323217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

You can use the abilities of some helpers to increase your income or production.&#10;&#10;Fields, customers, helpers, and miscellaneous objects are represented by cards. Each player receives two of these cards per round distributed by a bidding/drawing mechanism in which you end up with one of the cards you draw and one of the cards of a public offer filled by all players. Additionally, to these cards you always receive one field for free each round.&#10;&#10;Placing one good on a field fills the complete field with goods of this type. Each round, one unit per field is harvested. After planting, harvesting, and distributing cards, each player can use as many actions as he wants, only limited by the number of his cards or the number of goods he owns. At the end of his turn, he can invest the earned money on a scoring track, where early money is worth more than late money. The game ends after a certain number of rounds, and the player who is first on the scoring track wins.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;     Yucata (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;",1,4,60,120,"['Contracts', 'Income', 'Loans', 'Market', 'Open Drafting', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Turn Order: Progressive']",10,120,3.113,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Farming']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1190,10,59,111,0.13681349201225534,0.1469076345955988,0.0,0.0,0.10498151070724779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14325120330144708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12418446975578172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13506895921994122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1302517637557519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11635006309081353,0.1573568505355766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.175729555365424,0.11165910269596846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1454045456077034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1573568505355766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1454045456077034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09509135387565731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41223722257364576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2950463770242142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3089530521405424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1418777178481475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29710054899162264,0.1220767223383466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27482481504909717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2908090912154068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1461489996385113,0.0,0.0,0.18001691814350085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09150448964030336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14768100124548805

Quickly, glorious buildings were added, always being expanded, so that Nobility (bringing victory points) may want to move in. But to accomplish this, one needs merchants who can provide the necessary Rubles, or the glory is over. The competition isn't sleeping either, and can sometimes steal a desired card right out from under your nose.&#10;&#10;Saint Petersburg has a board to tally victory points and to set out the four types of cards.  It is the cards themselves that players need to collect.  In each round &ndash; with the number of rounds dependent on the number of players and the randomness of card availability &ndash; players first pay for CRAFTSMEN who supply money for further purchases; then BUILDINGS to score points; then ARISTOCRATS, who are needed for money, points, and end-of-game scoring; and finally, unique cards from all three categories which give greater benefits. During the first rounds, players never have enough money to buy every card they want. During later rounds, they have plenty of money, but the cards they'd like to buy may have already come and gone...&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Sankt Petersburg: Das Bankett&#10;    Saint Petersburg: New Society & Banquet Expansion (includes The Banquet)&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,4,45,60,"['Income', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection']",10,60,2.439,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Age of Reason', 'Card Game', 'City Building', 'Economic']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1351,11,75,133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13682293492463332,0.12688044304073276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09834315645622237,0.2382657877082765,0.0,0.2704384372604873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11076797844649411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1211784339705393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10433646101286216,0.0,0.07782358307035156,0.0,0.11320174910733881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10242920285698323,0.0,0.0,0.12566391962725793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09159157230226699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12688044304073276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11076797844649411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12878770119661168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1046646092671565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26253791595418635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4868356214591691,0.0,0.10181569725501519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21133555371493246,0.10705131429999627,0.0,0.17421896720182597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11492285546998407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08771595727163944,0.32437735093901576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09468165367038874,0.0,0.12170890536479227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08731048518723343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08459563190009932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12626693743876471,0.10003671445123818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18740342114854552,0.223121447569325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

During the course of the game, players will upgrade their characters by acquiring skills, allies, items, weapons, and spells.

272,436,215311,Downforce,2017,7.02718,"High-stakes bidding on million-dollar race cars. Frantic bets placed in secret even as the cars race around the track. And to the victor, the biggest purse of all. But in the world of motor racing, the margin between victory and defeat can be a single moment: a steep banked turn, tires screaming and spitting out smoke, and the downforce, pressing you down in your seat and keeping you on the track as you make your move inside to pull ahead.&#10;&#10;Downforce is a card-driven bidding, racing, and betting game for 2-6 players based on Top Race, the award-winning design by the legendary Wolfgang Kramer. Players first bid to own the six cars in the race, then they play cards from their hand to speed them around the track. However, most cards will also move their opponents' cars. So figuring out just the right time to play a card is the key to victory. Along the way, players make secret bets on who they think will win the race. Whoever has the most money from their prize money, winning bets, and remaining bank wins.&#10;&#10;This is a game whose design needed no attention. Years of play and multiple versions have honed it to near perfection. On the contrary, one of the design challenges was figuring which of the many rules modules to incorporate to create the most fun version. Downforce also adds variable player powers to improve replayability. But mostly, it improves the look of the game to make it gorgeous and easy to play. Special attention was paid to the colors, the layout of the cards, the design of the cars, the details on the board, and more.&#10;&#10;",2,6,20,40,"['Auction / Bidding', 'Betting and Bluffing', 'Hand Management', 'Moving Multiple Units', 'Player Elimination', 'Predictive Bid', 'Track Movement', 'Variable Player Powers']",10,40,1.726,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Racing', 'Sports']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1581,16,60,156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10159099321858918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1869486038122155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09572557905155776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11444544082009567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10784150075085822,0.0,0.12053790374953198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0931657556275686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11836993763566694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07705653925846503,0.0,0.11208272944595006,0.0,0.10282740580045761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2373683063218456,0.0,0.07329962378101704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21184423954177467,0.0,0.17721849435549772,0.0,0.0,0.11907571805903136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10079354328459735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09815510241355047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11096623926773873,0.0,0.0,0.5548311963386936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10001628414140165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08706101511496567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2197778647405519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11324136114937694,0.09474046470475612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08731369223104501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142898859772581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10784150075085822,0.0,0.3362481883378502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10199762295531606,0.12129596933392872,0.1630954412158611,0.0,0.0,0.09080304425342298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10282740580045761,0.08395251573958992,0.0,0.21769630293829823,0.07053474781396726,0.0,0.0,0.08582791376605078,0.0
273,438,33160,Endeavor,2009,7.02331,"It is a time when the maps of the world are still being filled in. Seagoing empires expand their frontiers by sending ships to the farthest reaches of the globe in search of new lands, new alliances, and new conquests. The wealth of the newly-discovered worlds abroad is a tempting prize for those with the strength and the cunning to seize it... and to hold it!&#10;You represent a growing empire engaged in a glorious endeavor to expand your&#10;influence and status at home and across the great oceans of the world. Through exploration and shipping, colonization and war, you will struggle with the other great powers to control the resources and the regions that unfold before you.&#10;&#10;The goal in Endeavor is to earn the most glory for your empire. Players earn glory by increasing their scores in Industry, Culture, Finance, and Politics, as well as by occupying cities, controlling connections between cities, and by holding certain Asset Cards and Building Tiles. Short-term goals of constructing useful buildings, gathering Trade Tokens, and obtaining Asset Cards must be balanced with the overall goal of attaining glory as you compete for control over the various regions of the world. The game only lasts seven rounds, and when it is over you want to be the one who has earned the most Glory points!&#10;&#10;Each round every player gets to build a new building, based on their Industry track. They then obtain new population markers based on their Culture track and retrieve used markers from building based on their Finance track. During the action phase, players take turns to either activate a building using a population marker or spend trade tokens to take an action: Ship, Occupy, Attack, Payment or Draw. Some buildings and tokens allow a player to take one or both of two actions. Shipping is used to open new regions for Occupation and Drawing, and gains you Trade Tokens. Once a shipping track is full, the player with the most influence in that region gains the powerful Governor card for that region. Occupation of a city results in glory and Trade Tokens, while Attacking steals a city from an opponent! Either Occupation or Attacking can result in claiming the connection between two cities, if both connected cities are controlled by the same player. Drawing gains a card from a region up to the maximum hand limit based on the player's Politics track. A player's influence in a region determines which cards they can draw.

274,441,21348,Ticket to Ride: Märklin,2006,7.02098,"Ticket to Ride: M&auml;rklin is the third installment in Days of Wonder's best-selling Ticket to Ride series.  The board for M&auml;rklin is based on a map of Germany and each individual card in the deck depicts a different M&auml;rklin Trains model.  A DVD introducing players to the M&auml;rklin line of model trains is included [Edit: DVD no longer included in recent runs.]&#10;&#10;M&auml;rklin is a heavier version in the TTR series, allowing players to not only travel from city to city but also from cities to countries. A new mechanic is also introduced in the form of passengers and merchandise tokens. When the game is set-up a series of merchandise values worth victory points are placed on nominated cities. The values of these tokens diminish when multiple tokens are present within a single city, requiring players to move quickly to capture the higher valued tokens.&#10;&#10;These tokens can be collected by the players by placing their Passengers (3 per player), which can be achieved at the end of a turn in which a player lays trains to enter the city in question. Once a passenger is in play a player can forfeit their regular turn to move a passenger. Moving along a player's own train network comes at no cost and allows a player to take the top merchandise token from each city that is passed through. A passenger can also move along sections of track featuring other players trains but a passenger card must be paid each time this occurs to do so.&#10;&#10;The player who completes the most destination tickets receives a 10 point bonus (instead of the base game's longest route bonus).&#10;&#10;",2,5,30,60,"['Hand Management', 'Network and Route Building', 'Open Drafting', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Set Collection']",8,60,2.2436,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Trains', 'Transportation']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1621,12,62,147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10539632119407781,0.1861079387979329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08768144519067536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08533673211113968,0.0,0.0,0.20034781105471158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2074506375268563,0.44953403874545683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10372531876342815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07025039546046186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0626584156923438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06203763404335754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21558196294890572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10017390552735579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10906939555737653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10427136051613614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24348936595990303,0.10597614104896089,0.0,0.10906939555737653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10906939555737653,0.0,0.0,0.08990680774909136,0.0,0.10017390552735579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08893144060854305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2677584557487082,0.06960018691631166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10372531876342815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06542657679180633,0.0,0.0,0.5421146208703187,0.09877922631602692,0.0,0.10266405067597696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09342642870740807,0.0,0.07469499861742974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10427136051613614

277,444,92415,Skull,2011,7.02019,"Edited description from Bruno Faidutti's write-up of the game in his Ideal Game Library:&#10;&#10;Skull &amp; Roses is the quintessence of bluffing, a game in which everything is played in the players' heads. Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more card &ndash; until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number of cards face up and get only roses. Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own. If he shows only roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing one of his cards out of play. Two successful challenges wins the game. Skull &amp; Roses is not a game of luck; it's a game of poker face and meeting eyes.&#10;&#10;Skull &amp; Roses Red features the same gameplay as Skull &amp; Roses, with the only change being alternate rules that allow each player to control two biker gangs. Both Skull &amp; Roses Red and Skull are playable on their own, with each game containing six different biker gangs. Each Skull or Skull &amp; Roses set can be combined with another to allow for games with more than six players.&#10;&#10;",3,6,15,45,"['Auction / Bidding', 'Bids As Wagers', 'Hand Management', 'Player Elimination']",10,45,1.1201,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Party Game']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1212,10,59,113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1990940384292707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6974543314700453,0.08723666895758274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12118896878937316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10150137530584219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09465688994649728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06834652415513938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09843151394183938,0.0,0.09308356998990214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44803718797632747,0.0,0.0,0.11255720037295264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11496416136219122,0.08387845750871653,0.07717060050171327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10774636898869501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11434448343002825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09188055249116787,0.0,0.0,0.1514873827859225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10926765667770702,0.0,0.0800393266244366,0.0,0.10926765667770702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08698421473917399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07591846687657565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18931377989299455,0.0,0.11969242738196549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14094505198042295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

281,451,171,Chess,1475,7.01428,"Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate (when the king cannot escape from the opponent's pieces), resignation (when one player recognizes he cannot win the game and ends it), or one of several types of draws.&#10;&#10;Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters. The game has its origins in the Indian game Chaturanga, and became Shatranj when introduced to the Persians. The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.&#10;&#10;",2,2,0,0,"['Grid Movement', 'Once-Per-Game Abilities', 'Pattern Movement', 'Square Grid', 'Static Capture', 'Sudden Death Ending']",6,0,3.6531,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Abstract Strategy'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1617,13,52,158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1744125703764488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1744125703764488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3466842386933692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1313876536226674,0.0,0.09800081272510988,0.1245400386930526,0.0,0.0,0.1348063837565404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36442580145089026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14641661643905338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1755094549494815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16741044548879058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525962252744587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1560414836671983,0.0,0.4816884916775272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11591532406545407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15065044408680509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1539424364224339,0.15128961436815394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14818194415653835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12977214583860533,0.16300867220374235,0.1590040191046378,0.12597311678271975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12147526715029676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24837775644564805,0.0

284,467,34219,Biblios,2007,7.00378,"THE GAME CONCEPT&#10;You are an abbot of a medieval monastery competing with other abbots to amass the greatest library of sacred books. To do so, you need to have both the workers and resources to run a well-functioning scriptorium. To acquire workers and resources, you use a limited supply of donated gold. In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.&#10;&#10;OUTLINE OF GAME PLAY&#10;The object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by winning any of the 5 categories: Illuminators, Scribes, Manuscripts, Scrolls, and Supplies. You win a category by having the highest total number of workers (Scribes, Illuminators) or resources (Manuscripts, Scrolls, Supplies) in that category. This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or fewer Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan. In the Auction stage, players purchase cards in auction rounds. After the two stages, winners of each category are determined and Victory Points awarded.

Teams take turns rotating a dial to where they think a hidden bullseye is located on a spectrum. One of the players on your team &mdash; the Psychic &mdash; knows exactly where the bullseye is, and draws a card with a pair of binaries on it (such as: Job - Career, Rough - Smooth, Fantasy - Sci-Fi, Sad Song - Happy Song, etc). The Psychic must then provide a clue that is *conceptually* where the bullseye is located between those two binaries.&#10;&#10;For example, if the card this round is HOT-COLD and the bullseye is slightly to the &quot;cold&quot; side of the centre, the Psychic needs to give a clue somewhere in that region. Perhaps &quot;salad&quot;?&#10;&#10;After the Psychic gives their clue, their team discusses where they think the bullseye is located and turns the dial to that location on that spectrum.

The Cheese System allows players to hoard the crumbs of precious cheese they find on their journey, and use it to bolster their mice with grandiose new abilities and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.&#10;&#10;Mice and Mystics will provide any group of friends with an unforgettable adventure they will be talking about for years to come &ndash; assuming they can all squeak by...&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Expansion advice:&#10;&#10;For those who have expansions for this game the recommended order by the game designer for playing them is as follows (see original post HERE):&#10;&#10;        Sorrow and Remembrance (Base game)&#10;        Cat&#039;s Cradle (Lost Chapter 1)&#10;        Heart of Glorm&#10;        The Ghost of Castle Andon (Lost Chapter 2)&#10;        Downwood Tales&#10;        Portents of Importance (Lost Chapter 3), connected to the story in Tail Feathers&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",1,4,60,90,"['Area Movement', 'Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Multiple Maps', 'Role Playing', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Storytelling', 'Variable Player Powers']",7,90,2.7299,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Animals', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2144,13,117,201,0.15273439746058248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3408630596365367,0.0,0.16664526115834255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15273439746058248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14713040129509294,0.16574701261187577,0.0,0.1495343267766747,0.15618277545135298,0.0,0.17457049673467318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17043152981826834,0.12910269647924782,0.0,0.0,0.1583879442729102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1298896513735964,0.0,0.0,0.1631562726083724,0.0,0.28859496416964536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17349907643742773,0.0,0.13767953892818913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26636924905710696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17143071323397638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11293336685499672,0.15273439746058248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10979358335429994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12191583252074428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16070821631343463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13582669621850432,0.17349907643742773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15207569221563036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17457049673467318,0.0,0.1640031894683917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1623251869006678,0.15207569221563036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13767953892818913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10048269041658443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13150662196082957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1495343267766747,0.0,0.0

Each player has four architects numbered 1-4 and on a turn, a player places an architect next to a row or column in the grid, claims the tile that's as far in as the number of the architect placed (e.g., the fourth tile in for architect #4), places that tile in the appropriately numbered row or column on the player's 4x4 city board, then claims any resources associated with the tile (inhabitants or energy).&#10;&#10;When a player takes a tile, a figure is placed in this now-empty space and the next player cannot place an architect in the same row or column where this tile was located. In addition, you can't place one architect on top of another, so each placement cuts off play options for you and everyone else later in the round.

296,514,158899,Colt Express,2014,6.95594,"On the 11th of July, 1899 at 10 a.m., the Union Pacific Express has left Folsom, New Mexico, with 47 passengers on board. After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?&#10;&#10;In Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.&#10;    Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!&#10;&#10;&#10;The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.&#10;&#10;Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &quot;steal&quot; card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items &mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.&#10;&#10;Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.&#10;&#10;You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!&#10;&#10;",2,6,40,40,"['Action Queue', 'Hand Management', 'Memory', 'Programmed Movement', 'Take That', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Variable Player Powers']",10,40,1.8346,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['American West', 'Fighting', 'Trains']",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3226,23,151,257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1820574215875117,0.057699788370327604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12451252395198711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06998638602944965,0.0,0.0,0.0664288903760162,0.0,0.0,0.07797862918101435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07797862918101435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15039047318201032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07654272231132553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10937038959582167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1918444678111511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09658422789582423,0.06136991696703846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0733178239317308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08541824446847501,0.3197407796852519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06002243124671809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11014526755980175,0.07951538152029196,0.1574670445986948,0.0,0.0,0.06873520372458743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10988544803131653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23393588754304304,0.08490316820924432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08032620499425713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1045279489218583,0.0,0.0,0.05481358068516257,0.0,0.08342689671254229,0.0,0.0,0.18954004915504227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0664288903760162,0.0,0.05405432315030093,0.08439993383887508,0.0,0.07519523659100516,0.0,0.05560012270236556,0.0,0.07724890390796783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05405432315030093,0.06998638602944965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1713596821012014,0.24008972498687237,0.07797862918101435,0.0,0.0,0.07131344269459933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38101462121681606,0.06709563423513916,0.0,0.0,0.08249527820032004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17083648893695003,0.0,0.13510337358725338,0.0,0.25625473340542504,0.0,0.0,0.06225626197599356,0.0,0.11750621154756628,0.07519523659100516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06189740588950315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05249439480988896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050930177308882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23067889643919762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08032620499425713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06474423388602105,0.0,0.0,0.08541824446847501,0.1466356478634616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0502925672493283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
297,516,205398,Citadels,2016,6.95562,"In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects their seventh building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players start the game with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The 2016 edition of Citadels includes twenty-seven characters &mdash; eight from the original Citadels, ten from the Dark City expansion, and nine new ones &mdash; along with thirty unique building districts, and the rulebook includes six preset lists of characters and districts beyond the starter list, each crafted to encourage a different style and intensity of gameplay.&#10;&#10;",2,8,30,60,"['Action Drafting', 'Closed Drafting', 'Income', 'Lose a Turn', 'Set Collection', 'Take That', 'Turn Order: Role Order', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up']",10,60,2.0435,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'City Building', 'Medieval']",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2077,12,68,159,0.0,0.0,0.06336698253844389,0.0,0.04598181398653537,0.0,0.06610896717287477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05772550934441008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.148838805402757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06214232189056576,0.0,0.0,0.38905500336860327,0.4713012078310265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059160091299557654,0.0,0.3728539313433946,0.30226424650895567,0.0,0.06892216907614379,0.0,0.055773185221090614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13005919430811738,0.0,0.05992419520518054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03886979764448928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0522539884352995,0.1930362636716287,0.0,0.0,0.038484699221382215,0.04890659369902749,0.0,0.06686753234210527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06214232189056576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09566552483320762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06538201823363336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26296682494768503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043784668660946845,0.05401753438429804,0.0,0.061277140444078074,0.0,0.0,0.10955219910705705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08736350486502775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05159563671430598,0.1292300666501265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0572723864625686,0.08861711877762994,0.05992419520518054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04783276241660381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06725955446052899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06807106124891185,0.0,0.26025958451152637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04682121819030157,0.06538201823363336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06305266322164275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05383293742232498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09922587026850468,0.0,0.09364243638060314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06849142496596845,0.04183355893771985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04946936024869164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04007889001813344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06468415517044482
298,518,12942,No Thanks!,2004,6.95423,"No Thanks! is a card game designed to be as simple as it is engaging.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple.  Each turn, players have two options:&#10;&#10;    play one of their chips to avoid picking up the current face-up card&#10;    pick up the face-up card (along with any chips that have already been played on that card) and turn over the next card&#10;&#10;&#10;However, the choices aren't so easy as players compete to have the lowest score at the end of the game.  The deck of cards is numbered from 3 to 35, with each card counting for a number of points equal to its face value.  Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors.  Each chip is worth -1 point, but they can be even more valuable by allowing you to avoid drawing that unwanted card.&#10;&#10;The first versions of the game supported up to five players, but the German 2011 edition supports up to seven (simply by increasing the number of chips).&#10;&#10;This game was originally published in Germany in 2004 by Amigo as Geschenkt ...ist noch zu teuer!, meaning Even given as a gift, it is still too expensive!.  Amigo's 2006 international edition, titled No Merci! (a delightful multi-lingual pun), had rules in several languages, including English. The game has subsequently been released in other countries under an assortment of names.

301,526,11,Bohnanza,1997,6.94784,"Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions, including a 2023 version with flowers.&#10;&#10;In the game, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.&#10;&#10;When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&#10;&#10;",2,7,45,45,"['Hand Management', 'Multi-Use Cards', 'Negotiation', 'Set Collection', 'Trading']",12,45,1.668,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Farming', 'Negotiation']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2345,18,97,182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08170218538787204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07822431154205188,0.07849647158727267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08925718615421814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09285968678422424,0.0,0.08233158214511371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3773483540969226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05609470209348977,0.09384705094120131,0.0,0.0994645914373969,0.08843171682523064,0.22623003659168897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11107789949027701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07639737635420674,0.0,0.0,0.08432008056552182,0.0,0.08968029794575577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09594614617426725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09706519969339546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20652712676358187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0919095906710508,0.0,0.0,0.3159378352393069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08432008056552182,0.09649945545803397,0.07904978087103938,0.09238015687624748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07469409971689836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12976381511623827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18911713243540604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07445991608405621,0.18649755155821887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25577446652436076,0.08647922247939187,0.0,0.0,0.08843171682523064,0.0,0.0,0.06216585051940629,0.0,0.0,0.08968029794575577,0.0,0.0,0.06902954789239729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09706519969339546,0.0,0.0,0.0994645914373969,0.08201491685040233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14278278736031963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062309295688093166,0.0,0.09099405126747892,0.08724214628802865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08647922247939187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0919095906710508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1964726411425895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36952062750498993,0.0,0.0,0.05689396157212249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1672792913160451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07422789085641039,0.0,0.08432008056552182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057839596088653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

304,531,478,Citadels,2000,6.94136,"In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion and can be recognized by its rectangular box (not square).

You must help Robinson to survive the island and prepare him to defeat the pirates that are coming for the island.&#10;&#10;Friday is a solitaire deck-building game in which you optimize your deck of fight cards in order to defeat the hazards of the island. During a turn the player will attempt to defeat hazard cards by playing fight cards from their deck. If defeated, a hazard card will become a fight card and is added to the player's deck. If failed, the player will lose life points but also get the opportunity to remove unwanted cards from their fight deck. In the end, the player will use their optimized fight deck to defeat the two pirate ships coming for the island, allowing Robinson Crusoe to escape the island and allowing you to finally have your peace back!&#10;&#10;",1,1,25,25,"['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Push Your Luck', 'Solo / Solitaire Game']",13,25,2.1569,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Card Game', 'Fighting', 'Novel-based', 'Pirates', 'Print & Play']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1073,8,36,93,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15700746576644786,0.0,0.0,0.12425568998771913,0.12468800359380076,0.0,0.12785259576125277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11148209457062053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.59940035495023,0.6280298630657914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08822104516785144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10060784080501478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12382800014519559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1490716867702038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1417808994840755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10157146861605847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10965023448367621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13561662666633775,0.0,0.0,0.1269225859589884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14599412101161058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09037341859478666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

You and your team must keep the world's hotspots in check before they break out of control, while researching cures to the four plagues.&#10;&#10;Players roll dice each turn to determine the actions available to them. They can fly and sail between the six major population centers of the world, treat disease in their current region, collect samples for further study, and exchange knowledge to help them in their goal of discovering cures. Each player takes on a different role that has its own unique set of dice and abilities &mdash; and players must take advantage of their specializations if they are to have any hope of winning the game. The Dispatcher, for example, can spend dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease. Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the more likely the next epidemic will occur.&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn, new &quot;infection dice&quot; are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations. If any region on the board is infected with more than three dice of a given color, an outbreak occurs, spreading disease into an adjacent region. If too many outbreaks take place, too many people get infected, or the rate of infection gets too high, all the players lose.

Players must act as a team to avoid errors and to finish the fireworks display before they run out of cards.&#10;&#10;An extra suit of cards, rainbow colored, is also provided for advanced or variant play.&#10;&#10;Hanabi was originally published as part of Hanabi & Ikebana.&#10;&#10;",2,5,25,25,"['Communication Limits', 'Cooperative Game', 'Hand Management', 'Memory', 'Ordering', 'Set Collection']",8,25,1.6886,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Deduction', 'Memory']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1046,10,79,111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32737006037577604,0.35680001672402295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16733993307193062,0.0,0.0,0.17840000836201148,0.0,0.0,0.1681056449069728,0.11955436860852114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10663409475501859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18674385860406542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1312227906761319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17212952393438313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23967009916319057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2867036666926072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24310922138258764,0.0,0.0,0.15963845447106784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11817513860336624,0.0,0.0,0.17047915457092477,0.0,0.0,0.1312227906761319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31181505876169957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18035358445500774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1502709081103074,0.0,0.0,0.15963845447106784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2963797719067542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14110466143230072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, players must first get their goods through the city gate, which is under the watch of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Should you play it safe with legal goods and make a profit, or risk it all by sneaking in illicit goods? Be mindful, though, as the Sheriff always has his eyes out for liars and tricksters and if he catches one, he very well may confiscate those goods for himself!&#10;&#10;In Sheriff of Nottingham, players will not only be able to experience Nottingham as a merchant of the city, but each turn one player will step into the shoes of the Sheriff himself. Players declare goods they wish to bring into the city, goods that are secretly stored in their burlap sack. The Sheriff must then determine who gets into the city with their goods, who gets inspected, and who may have their goods confiscated!&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to be seen as an honest merchant?

318,558,13,CATAN,1995,6.91919,"In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine which resources the island produces. Players build structures by 'spending' resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) which are represented by the relevant resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.&#10;&#10;Set-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each depicting one of the five resource-producing terrain types--or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. A number disk, the value of which will correspond to the roll of two 6-sided dice, are placed on each terrain tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are placed on intersections and borders of the terrain tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which terrain tiles their last-placed settlement is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of rolling the dice, collecting resource cards based on this dice roll and the position of settlements (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels), turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, possibly playing a development card, or trading resource cards with other players. If the dice roll is a 7, the active player moves the robber to a new terrain tile and steals a resource card from another player who has a settlement adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road or the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), s/he announces this and claims the win.&#10;&#10;",3,4,60,120,"['Chaining', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Income', 'Modular Board', 'Negotiation', 'Network and Route Building', 'Race', 'Random Production', 'Trading', 'Variable Set-up']",10,120,2.2901,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Negotiation']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2104,12,92,162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07878091644678589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17274149454418766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07376880554786655,0.1544461622288971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09394094900942435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3065243714842248,0.0,0.0,0.08697956108684453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09685942617857977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10680217418833492,0.4009484510223744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07595416092928994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10875827469115087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06952614905959928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08697956108684453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10271266979315638,0.1094422579237865,0.08922239711452558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06871851419701451,0.0693627272670515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06840194031137799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3542513768221198,0.0,0.09867646522872289,0.0,0.0,0.07595416092928994,0.0,0.0,0.08117032052122229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17274149454418766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2760895573130897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09914997955396396,0.0,0.0,0.06855977500332694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1094422579237865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36377376830508246,0.328747780832015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08577502724793988,0.0,0.0,0.10164715714188163,0.09914997955396396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09394094900942435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07357842738615712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07574821266837353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
319,560,245654,Railroad Ink: Deep Blue Edition,2018,6.91768,"In the multiplayer puzzle game Railroad Ink, your goal is to connect as many exits on your board as possible. Each round, a set of dice are rolled in the middle of the table, determining which kind of road and railway routes are available to all players. You have to draw these routes on your erasable boards to create transport lines and connect your exits, trying to optimize the available symbols better than your opponents.&#10;&#10;The more exits you connect, the more points you score at the end of the game, but you lose points for each incomplete route, so plan carefully! Will you press your luck and try to stretch your transportation network to the next exit, or will you play it safe and start a new, simpler to manage route?&#10;&#10;Railroad Ink comes in two versions, each one including two expansions with additional dice sets that add new special rules to your games. The Deep Blue Edition includes the Rivers and Lakes expansions. Increase the difficulty by adding the River route into the mix, or use the Lakes to connect your networks by ferry. These special rules can spice up things and make each game play and feel different. Each box allows you to play from 1 to 6 players, and if you combine more boxes, you can play with up to 12 players (or more). The only limit to the number of players is the number of boards you have!&#10;&#10;",1,6,20,30,"['Bingo', 'Connections', 'Dice Rolling', 'Line Drawing', 'Network and Route Building', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game']",8,30,1.4631,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Dice', 'Trains']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1358,11,44,133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14622354145035443,0.0,0.15551895439380503,0.0,0.0,0.16362670081362132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27514369094584995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16103248678716334,0.0,0.0,0.15478521571408496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1724863723011644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16103248678716334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1533537293132933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2527657784428419,0.0,0.09727654363824935,0.0,0.12753687069384184,0.0,0.0,0.13077215973157086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09631278653554917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11938290253992606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13708405912700553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13708405912700553,0.16020091071530182,0.1724863723011644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15478521571408496,0.162744722861489,0.0,0.1125148628366231,0.0,0.10423418244196558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12912455197960146,0.2156096331800199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14333133020008387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17035636821794736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12792841075134126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10855537531377503,0.0,0.0,0.24760655689548594,0.0,0.11717597081781024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10805357181449103,0.15779719774943432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24832518521191516,0.0,0.11717597081781024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13708405912700553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13518565465209653,0.1456295673384207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09866257826629533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1724863723011644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

321,562,21790,Thurn and Taxis,2006,6.91623,"In Thurn &amp; Taxis, players build post office routes across Bavaria and the regions around, collecting bonus points in various ways. The board shows a map of all the cities, with roads leading from each one to some of its neighbors. There are various colored regions around the board, most with two or three cities, and a large region with all the Bavarian cities in the center.&#10;&#10;Players build postal routes from city to city to city so that each city is adjacent to the next city on the route and there is a road connecting these two cities. Each route must consist of at least three cities. Players may build only one route at a time. Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route.&#10;&#10;Players start with a supply of 20 post offices in their color, a carriage house card, and a player aid card. The board is populated with bonus tiles, carriage cards and city cards. On a turn, a player will draw a card from a display of six, face-up city cards (or the top of the face-down deck) and meld one card, either starting a new route or adding to the current one. If after adding to the route, the length of the route is at least three cities, the player may declare it finished and score it. The player may, depending on the length of the route and which cities are in the route, place post offices in the cities, collect bonus tiles, and acquire a higher value carriage. Optionally, the player may receive support from one postal official in the form of drawing a second card, melding a second card, refreshing the six city card display, or acquiring a higher value carriage than the route length when finishing a route. Once a route is scored, the city cards of that route are discarded, and the player begins a new route on their next turn.&#10;&#10;When a player exhausts their supply of post offices or acquires a value 7 carriage, the end of the game is triggered.

Many people feel that it is reminiscent of Go.&#10;&#10;Publisher's Description&#10;From the award-winning game designer Reiner Knizia comes a game of strategy, patience, and cool plastic camels! The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy. But for those willing to risk the dangers of the shifting, sun-baked sands, the desert holds riches beyond compare.&#10; In Through the Desert, two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert. By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.&#10; Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe's caravans. There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert's oases? Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponents' caravans, or you may find your own tribe cut off from valuable water holes.&#10;&#10;Through the Desert is part of the so called Knizia tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;",2,5,45,45,"['Chaining', 'Connections', 'Enclosure', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Hidden Victory Points', 'Network and Route Building']",10,45,2.1836,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Abstract Strategy', 'Animals', 'Arabian']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1200,13,58,124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23486228801111772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17001632877299394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16265008559126404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29183301180049387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13607699992989264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14310695961326816,0.12090996924331784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28196297972299866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15213736104794018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17421902733944125,0.0,0.0,0.14310695961326816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10528123258835864,0.0,0.10939168225085939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17103005065962362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14477111786621027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14709244118871206,0.15489419368846893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14365473013575364,0.0,0.0,0.13337646472440218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16527035894022585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11835302343648307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15281057962090974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17313020757487416,0.29418488237742413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15281057962090974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14477111786621027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1365436176175808,0.14709244118871206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3323591311694836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12058212416427999,0.0,0.1563400596143875,0.0,0.15708116882433112,0.0,0.0,0.0

Otherwise, the player can stop whenever he likes, then use/acquire one card if three or fewer ships are in the harbor, two cards if four ships are present, and three cards if five ships are present. Players rob ships, collecting the number of coins shown on them, then discarding the card, while they hire people, paying the number of coins depicted.

At the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, one of the most exciting and interesting project of the Spanish Middle Ages begins: the construction of the ALHAMBRA.&#10;&#10;The best master builders in the whole of Europe and Arabia want to demonstrate their skill.  Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency.  Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their &quot;native&quot; currency.  With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.&#10;&#10;In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.&#10;&#10;The money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market.  The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.  On a player's turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.&#10;&#10;Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external &quot;wall&quot; section within their complex. The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Alhambra: The Dice Game (a variant in which you can combine Alhambra buildings with Alhambra dice.)&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,6,45,60,"['Hand Management', 'Memory', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection', 'Tile Placement']",8,60,2.1008,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['City Building', 'Medieval']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2077,14,94,155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0856591730976301,0.0,0.0677325205995165,0.0,0.0,0.22514239583366977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07614261092728833,0.0,0.09350579319373718,0.07227218665218832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5311452740842966,0.40214334580299116,0.09128882416540651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08784559020217787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1378874501240975,0.0,0.10613157083047807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0704393424243144,0.0,0.0,0.06676820986720046,0.07642445115538453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929319046695493,0.0,0.0,0.18550514542903854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07374576308615921,0.0,0.08365671505176772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061378512681505334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11816258018682506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4108388945654495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05880911317294439,0.15228522185457666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07758639971344508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12784243129286688,0.0,0.16433555782617978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14698749562078525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07818934891399379,0.0,0.05541015753629858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17048996979152278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15063313337421835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929319046695493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05471646126989194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Einfach Genial, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each line of colored symbols that they enlarge. The trick, however, is that a player's score is equal to their worst-scoring color, not their best, so they need to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two conjoined hexes; each hex has one of six colors in it, with most tiles having different-colored hexes. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from their rack onto two hexes of the game board. For each hex on this tile, they score one point in that color for each hex of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each hex in a straight line from it. If a player brings the score of a color to 18, they immediately take another turn. At the end of their turn, they refill their rack to six tiles. (Before refilling their rack, if they have no tiles on it that contain hexes in their lowest-scoring color, they can discard all of their tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)&#10;&#10;When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.&#10;&#10;Ingenious includes rules for solitaire and team play; in the latter case, two teams of two play, with each player not being able to see their partner's tiles and teams keeping a combined score that maxes out at 36 instead of 18.&#10;&#10;",1,4,30,45,"['Hand Management', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Highest-Lowest Scoring', 'Pattern Building', 'Team-Based Game', 'Tile Placement']",8,45,1.9077,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Abstract Strategy'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1617,14,70,125,0.0,0.07614903264264129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05871399930526147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06264921310069484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42366554778175936,0.15391742946846212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04600012609047566,0.07695871473423106,0.06030962772401188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04554438468985945,0.05787808563829446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07251790227137966,0.06914617946465977,0.0,0.1296486032292987,0.0,0.0,0.14708358755380446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1601446794596926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06264921310069484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07913380324818556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0660042940306213,0.07575579699991836,0.07354179377690223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06528823680265007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05854408684778939,0.0,0.33246099609199714,0.15475156883011504,0.21368164972967843,0.0,0.0,0.07061092463029323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2548324981669888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06886530102242155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13555702156602892,0.6125245124691828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06030962772401188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06914617946465977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04743101601049429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Who doesn't love schadenfreude? (Well, other than those being schadened, I suppose...)&#10;&#10;In more detail, Las Vegas includes six cardboard casino mats, one for each side of a normal six-sided die. For each mat, players draw money cards until at least $50k is showing, but the amount may end up being a lot more, making that casino more desirable.&#10;&#10;Each player has eight dice of a different color, which they take turns rolling. When you roll your dice, you can choose to place them on the relevant casino cards; for example, a die showing a 1 will be placed on the casino mat marked &quot;1&quot;. You must place all dice of one number on one casino in your turn. All players take turns doing this until all the dice have been used. Finally, the player with the most dice on each casino card takes the money associated with it. In case of a tie, the next non-tied player takes the highest-valued money card at that casino.&#10;&#10;Las Vegas rates a 1 out of 10 on alea's difficulty scale.&#10;&#10;",2,5,30,30,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Dice Rolling']",8,30,1.1759,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Dice'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1172,14,76,126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0988480594633869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12059405212949667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.612413013448959,0.25001401423029374,0.07856208699663937,0.0,0.10300080940364574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1300524028002562,0.0,0.0,0.077783741400526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13758251804402585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13594233284186963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1238509158834136,0.0,0.0,0.11071127094151428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1268154867830084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13143523194281084,0.0,0.0,0.13514999334852065,0.0,0.0,0.08746783668369935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36493979000471105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10428304611385034,0.08706488802785688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17412977605571375,0.11272654078352802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11713949576917823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12007933315416894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21760997840733198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19939536373435834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20600161880729148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10461102637312457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10395808875710486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The earlier you place your bet, the more you can win &mdash; should you guess correctly, of course. Camels don't run neatly, however, sometimes landing on top of another one and being carried toward the finish line. Who's going to run when? That all depends on how the dice come out of the pyramid dice shaker, which releases one die at a time when players pause from their bets long enough to see who's actually moving!&#10;&#10;Players roll all 5 dice to setup the start positions of the camels.  On each leg, players pick one betting card for each color camel, showing how many coins they will win/lose, depending on the camel's position after the leg.  The dice are then rolled in the pyramid dice roller, which allows one die to come out at a time and moves the matching color camel.  Players can also place oasis cards to earn extra coins.  After all 5 camels are moved, bets are resolved and a new leg start.  Play continues until a camel passes the finish line.&#10;&#10;Once a camel crossess the finish line, all end of race bets are resolved and the player with the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;",2,8,20,30,"['Betting and Bluffing', 'Dice Rolling', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Track Movement', 'Variable Set-up']",8,30,1.4968,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Animals', 'Arabian', 'Dice', 'Racing']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1249,12,50,124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12060779694734283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09151915111050365,0.09797648619024078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2201264419987516,0.0,0.0,0.22107990431600105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10822393385313452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4657785607435152,0.2281816326365843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11303568032703229,0.0,0.11869562468581578,0.0,0.0,0.07099130486743452,0.0,0.10326355540763488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12556817539284246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08823533217279293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077800817866127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37443297916434215,0.0,0.0,0.11463164862289806,0.11409081631829215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07683009587324238,0.0,0.0,0.08057811719514371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12127130013731664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2383859363645694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23262184338363398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10691033249926768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24254260027463329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10913043787279252,0.0,0.1100632209993758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17273874771330427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14973872331151727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11303568032703229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10734226871131468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17599216749985583,0.0,0.0,0.07393204981695319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

333,596,18,RoboRally,1994,6.88943,"The robots of the RoboRally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. &#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;UPC 742818050029&#10;&#10;",2,8,45,120,"['Action Queue', 'Bias', 'Grid Movement', 'Lose a Turn', 'Modular Board', 'Programmed Movement', 'Race', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']",12,120,2.4291,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Maze', 'Miniatures', 'Racing', 'Science Fiction']",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2404,26,89,224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08633182458942615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08856595861302997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.298688573895583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08681463118765151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10560895426568592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12303561475248714,0.0,0.0,0.12303561475248714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10304802684377892,0.0,0.0,0.10473170183804227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20816391210255086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19986277546268175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20860434448952336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0909728524061455,0.0,0.11369023716323766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07834650602604568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11369023716323766,0.10938818011491205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11427231769563054,0.0,0.0,0.0923950357030962,0.12078352029286044,0.0,0.0,0.11093264878976553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08025755967390265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3090149929105071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1797601892154532,0.1173580482181421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09210535545794245,0.07689785404769313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.237290740393437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07689785404769313,0.09956285796519435,0.0,0.0,0.12151626943663607,0.0,0.08538810382962175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12006761745828355,0.22511546822288137,0.0,0.11671595532993469,0.0,0.2460712295049743,0.10145073304719193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10651163781094912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21583341258944272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12151626943663607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10430217224476168,0.12078352029286044,0.0,0.12303561475248714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08805544878967438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07245343412092538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0923950357030962,0.0,0.0,0.12078352029286044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1173580482181421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14309273599705072,0.0,0.0,0.08705887088513266,0.0

But as the clever game system keeps creatures on the march toward the castle, the players must balance their priorities carefully.&#10;&#10;At the heart of Legends of Andor is its unique narrative, the linked scenarios of which tell an overarching story as the players successfully complete objectives.

A wooden marker moves along the board's legend track at key points during each scenario, triggering the draw of a new legend card, the introduction of new game-altering effects, and the advancement of the story's plot. In the end, the players must endeavor to guide the fate of Andor through their heroic actions, bringing a happy ending to their epic fantasy tale.&#10;&#10;Will their heroes roam the land completing quests in the name of glory, or devote themselves to the defense of the realm?

But as they go to Elysium, most cards lose their power and players will therefore have to renounce some of their combinations !&#10;&#10;A game of balance and opportunity with  simple action, but constant dilemmas and complex strategies.&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,60,"['Open Drafting', 'Set Collection', 'Take That', 'Turn Order: Claim Action', 'Variable Set-up']",14,60,2.7737,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Ancient', 'Card Game', 'Mythology']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1360,12,64,121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11181237208159431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12894850043137765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1593491623907798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14167373334809652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17973519347905648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42502120004428956,0.0,0.14876764781414312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3074247389256242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11059011531546896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13915220066117645,0.0,0.151995881200729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12488940748576105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15643236983044376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3147627748361187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14299619236846284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09629531564159877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26278715098099426,0.2758963785272875,0.2915575410801872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13139357549049713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12801051893264911,0.09982380597527869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13735939944049516,0.0,0.14955080614160948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12488940748576105,0.0,0.11782318363981094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071310204709024,0.12754958378321074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
339,605,105551,Archipelago,2012,6.88256,"In Archipelago, players are Renaissance European powers competing in the exploration of a Pacific or Caribbean archipelago. They will explore territories, harvest resources, use those resources in markets both internal (for their use and that of the natives) and foreign (to sell it in Europe), build markets, harbors, cities and temples, and negotiate among themselves (and maybe betray each other) &ndash; all this to complete their secret objectives. They will also need to guess the secret objective of the other players to be able to benefit from them.&#10;&#10;But players also need to be careful of the natives; if they make them too unhappy or if too many of them are unoccupied, they could revolt and declare independence. Then everyone will lose!&#10;&#10;According to the author, what he's tried to create is a &quot;German&quot; economic worker-placement game, but without the two things he dislikes in them: the superficial theme and the lack of interaction. Indeed this game includes a very present theme and a lot of negotiation and potential backstabbing.&#10;&#10;The game includes three sets of objectives, enabling players to choose between a short, medium and a long game.

340,609,97842,Last Will,2011,6.88021,"In his last will, your rich uncle stated that all of his millions will go to the nephew who can enjoy money the most. How to find out which nephew should be rich? You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance &ndash; oh, and win the game.&#10;&#10;In Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.&#10;&#10;Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take a card on display and add it to your hand.&#10;    Draw a card from any regular deck &ndash; This can be chosen only once by each player.&#10;    Visit the opera and spend $2.&#10;    Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.&#10;    Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses &ndash; of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! &ndash; to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.&#10;&#10;If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins.&#10;&#10;",2,5,45,75,"['Action Points', 'Hand Management', 'Victory Points as a Resource', 'Worker Placement']",14,75,2.7184,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Economic', 'Humor']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3342,27,145,240,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05090699018616454,0.29041280286506843,0.06150350330381012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06604652442177586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05786448863590144,0.0,0.05705721781926391,0.0,0.0,0.058708888146925854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07038720240509225,0.0,0.07165408081074912,0.0,0.06227406896521043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07254998793945004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06175678254230405,0.0,0.09174661435818235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06845252481856771,0.05364364910242224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040510397478640395,0.10296172713612886,0.0,0.0,0.05572464183489719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05959399700794626,0.0,0.09535441194745042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04619831484340807,0.0,0.0,0.07209657098497659,0.1267090498406087,0.057659319421421724,0.0,0.06703933126696042,0.0,0.0,0.13826801561229565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07254998793945004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07254998793945004,0.11829222016043171,0.06703933126696042,0.06604652442177586,0.0,0.0,0.06845252481856771,0.05448226303749323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08768447707670862,0.0,0.04555395210945076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5701907242827391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22001781322818748,0.0,0.0,0.1360322796359324,0.07079985917931851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13992241505290662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058708888146925854,0.0,0.0,0.21496224243224735,0.0,0.15105152883107786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06637153208609275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41093809083207883,0.056283947620902886,0.0,0.0,0.06920211680131821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06637153208609275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10444876862926825,0.0,0.049285721278794006,0.06307839259402981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0854467347884506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05364364910242224,0.0,0.0,0.05207325215562838,0.08299750024073584,0.0,0.0,0.06227406896521043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05431144828328989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06150350330381012,0.05021398516240756,0.0,0.0,0.04218850083243511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
341,610,28023,Jamaica,2007,6.8793,"Summary: This is a pirate-themed tactical race game with player interaction and side goals (e.g. detouring for treasure).  The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.&#10;&#10;Setting: Jamaica, 1675.&#10;After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former &quot;colleagues&quot; to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance  of the &quot;good old days,&quot; Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.&#10;&#10;Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player's ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five &quot;holds&quot; of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as &quot;captain,&quot; with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the &quot;day&quot; and which to the &quot;night.&quot; Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to &quot;day&quot; - and one on the right (&quot;night&quot;). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain's. When it is a player's turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice.  Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a &quot;combat&quot; die, but players may improve their chances by using &quot;gunpowder&quot; tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.&#10;&#10;",2,6,30,60,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Hidden Victory Points', 'Race', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Take That', 'Track Movement', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Victory Points as a Resource']",8,60,1.6595,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Nautical', 'Pirates', 'Racing']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3286,25,140,244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061620524893631866,0.07222597216955853,0.06697753818078156,0.0,0.052960556592860704,0.1133946103888709,0.0,0.0,0.07179787752485131,0.0,0.0,0.13395507636156312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11302030981290054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07097012805579431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10781521256119696,0.19806717154931447,0.041492528356436666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05507704050886048,0.0,0.04108144550524888,0.05220655493073607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05407023872842393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0543998278087943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05106026712796665,0.0,0.07179787752485131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0697936549701772,0.0,0.0,0.06764265520201312,0.0,0.07311286821108792,0.0,0.05847210435123023,0.4912432898749345,0.13596867992243622,0.06137710578151896,0.0,0.09347805834276508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06633536085682891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06697753818078156,0.13666482343988154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14445194433911707,0.0,0.0,0.06633536085682891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0923921915167507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05374638192358328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05507704050886048,0.13794983586040813,0.07179787752485131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04729826930637265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06833241171994077,0.0,0.0,0.09718223627747728,0.0,0.0,0.05889057807249368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47114989082806347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12133075445857691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13891027024564306,0.05707734485270242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12683968378117275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07222597216955853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08931253753105627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07179787752485131,0.0,0.07056965462294186,0.0,0.0,0.2924514728443517,0.0,0.0,0.0543998278087943,0.06833241171994077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057270313386918716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05507704050886048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23727469086880357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
342,611,183251,Karuba,2015,6.87896,"This is a tile-laying race game with players starting with boards that are identical, and one player drawing tiles that they all will use. They race to get their explorers to temples first and earn points. Along the way they can collect additional points by collecting items off the paths they create. The game ends when one player gets all of their explorers to their corresponding temples or whenever the last tile is drawn and placed. Most points wins.&#10;&#10;Description from the English Ruleset:&#10;&#10;Many moons have come and gone since your boats departed on the journey to Karuba. Once you arrive on the island, each player will lead an expedition team of four adventurers. Now you just have to navigate your way through the dense jungle to make it to the temples. &bdquo;Just&ldquo; may be something of an understatement; the ancient jungle trails have to be found and uncovered first!

343,612,133848,Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia,2013,6.87809,"You find yourself in a dystopian cityscape with a few workers at your disposal to make your mark on the world. Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they've ever known, and you may use them at your whim.&#10;&#10;The world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future.&#10;&#10;The Euphorians aren&rsquo;t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand&mdash;they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past.&#10;&#10;There is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterra, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they&rsquo;ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways.&#10;&#10;In Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.&#10;&#10;Euphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker's knowledge&mdash;that is, his level of awareness that he's in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your available workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.&#10;&#10;Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts&mdash;especially matching pairs&mdash;and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.&#10;&#10;Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history. What are you willing to sacrifice to build a better dystopia?&#10;&#10;",2,6,60,60,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Race', 'Set Collection', 'Trading', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Worker Placement', 'Worker Placement with Dice Workers']",13,60,3.1167,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Science Fiction'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3075,30,126,252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07289183580580327,0.07803487966781338,0.0,0.08076397376412894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18907391251955677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13650878674957823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0869186160745108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3277701549808664,0.10126116139034179,0.08047761020253745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08481091347554902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14839060004210664,0.0908693857964396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09940763547427817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09824246791750367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07487276515966872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08317792352982348,0.0,0.06654514198920697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09309942405549358,0.09218399559661308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18713939824745127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10126116139034179,0.09767916453614368,0.1900692553328096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10001070499569899,0.0,0.07604325496173853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06605383099262124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06358162458101108,0.2567107241210015,0.08921531047549969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06328871542568526,0.09881843085561771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06509859227279227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09002900650429733,0.0,0.0,0.06328871542568526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09605993527377019,0.0,0.10126116139034179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1669926073507511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18347651577975896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0854944012371806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17532309109068148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11584320694700025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07829507755880395,0.0,0.0,0.13615649296244747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5732117415202098,0.0

By influencing the prominent forces, building magnificent palaces, and ensuring a steady supply of commodities, the princes increase their power until the most successful has won.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to gain the most influence points. These can be obtained by building palaces and by acquiring commodities. A palace can be built after securing the support of the Vizier, the General, the Monk, the Princess, or the Grand Mogul. Commodities are gained by seizing control of a region or by retrieving them on a space where a palace has just been built.&#10;&#10;There are twelve turns with an auction for the region control and the support of the Vizier, General, Monk, Princess, and Grand Mogul, each represented by a different symbol. Players use cards in four colors to bid for the various prizes, and each player may only play one color in any given turn. During your turn you can either increase your bid by playing more cards or withdraw. When you do, you gain the reward for every symbol you have the majority of. You place palaces, gain region tiles, and increase your score accordingly. There are bonus points for connecting palaces over several regions on the map.After the final area on the board is auctioned, the player with the highest point total wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game is #3 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;Note: the 2018 edition from Fantasy Flight Games includes rules for 2 players.

Play continues until the heroes reduce the villain to 0 or fewer HP, or until the villain defeats the heroes, either via a win condition or by reducing all the heroes to 0 or fewer HP.&#10;&#10;",2,5,30,60,"['Cooperative Game', 'Hand Management', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Variable Player Powers']",8,60,2.5113,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Comic Book / Strip', 'Fighting']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1596,14,56,145,0.15383119338197324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13634744270989183,0.0,0.0,0.17266176864914348,0.0,0.0,0.16106966669114262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15186966489974119,0.0,0.15952533869200838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16693725299281106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4474905144241318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09978252253024285,0.0,0.1308223976457267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13245097980687232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23254370285746495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1123994708462175,0.13866822490375247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11109380769042171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11058201841817576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31905067738401677,0.0,0.0,0.14588998573879655,0.0,0.16186227276121054,0.0,0.17266176864914348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11135191257727406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15383119338197324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14061553491502876,0.12662706106000388,0.0,0.14938118728862554,0.17582409914511357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1573043344056857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1308223976457267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10120426333566261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1368020768066713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13245097980687232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12245837194540295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25038788878853324,0.0

Dark magic once more thrums amid crumbling ruins, giants gather in titanic armies, cultists murder in the name of foul deities, and maniacal goblins plot a fiery end for the peaceful town of Sandpoint.&#10;&#10;Launch a campaign to strike back against the evils plaguing Varisia with the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords - Base Set. This complete cooperative strategy card game pits 1 to 4 heroes against the traps, monsters, deadly magic, and despicable foes of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game's award-winning Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path. In this game players take the part of a fantasy character such as a rogue or wizard, each with varying skills and proficiencies that are represented by the cards in their deck. The classic ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, etc.) are assigned with different sized dice. Players can acquire allies, spells, weapons, and other items. The goal is to find and defeat a villain before a certain number of turns pass, with the villain being represented by its own deck of cards complete with challenges and foes that must be overcome. Characters grow stronger after each game, adding unique gear and awesome magic to their decks, and gaining incredible powers, all of which they'll need to challenge greater threats in a complete Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Adventure Path.&#10;&#10;The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is an expandable game, with the first set containing nearly 500 cards. The Rise of the Runelords - Base Set supports 1 to 4 players; a 110-card Character Add-On Deck expands the possible number of players to 5 or 6 and adds more character options for any number of players. The game will be expanded with bimonthly 110-card adventure decks.&#10;&#10;Errata: Early printings had the Loot card &quot;Sihedron Medallion&quot; listed as belonging to &quot;B&quot;  (for Base Set).

When the location of one of the treasures is finally revealed players try to reach it as quickly as possible to secure the findings. The more clues you have provided, the more of a stake you will have in the loot.&#10;Players can carefully play their clues and use bonus-action gems to influence where and when the treasure is found in order to ensure a more favourable outcome when the loot is finally 'dug up' and shared.&#10;&#10;The game features a 3 piece, double-sided, modular game board which can be rearranged to create 32 possible island arrangements.&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,60,"['Deduction', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Modular Board', 'Push Your Luck']",10,60,2.1292,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Deduction', 'Exploration']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,830,6,29,81,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13830574760929554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19123021445901248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17771688480017467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19710613973281152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17524260725825289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1830671181236315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38246042891802495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1267152385845948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43856465068423534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18698188688365652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5876228459203138,0.1544813203515201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2254902770428847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in its row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.)

(If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)&#10;&#10;&#10;When you take one of the character actions &ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action &ndash; that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you.

361,675,699,HeroQuest,1989,6.82895,"HeroQuest is Milton Bradley's approach to a Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style adventure game.  One player acts as game master, revealing the maze-like dungeon piecemeal as the players wander.  Up to four other players take on a character (wizard, elf, dwarf, or barbarian) and venture forth into dungeons on fantasy quests. This game was made in cooperation with Games Workshop Ltd. who designed the miniatures and helped in many of the production details including background world and art in the rule book and scenario book. The HeroQuest series consists of the main game and a number of expansions.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a grid representing the interior of a dungeon or castle, with walls segmenting the grid into rooms and corridors. One player assumes the role of the evil wizard character (Zargon/Morcar), and uses a map taken from the game's quest book to determine how the quest is to be played. The map details the placement of monsters, artifacts, and doors, as well as the overall quest the other players are embarking upon. During a Hero's turn, the player can move before or after performing one of the following actions: attack, cast a spell, search for traps and secret doors, search for treasure.&#10;&#10;The game ends when every player has either returned to the spiral staircase, exited by a door, or been killed by the evil wizard. If the objective of the quest has not been accomplished then the evil wizard character wins. Items collected during the quest may be kept for future quests. The quests usually form part of a longer story, especially the quests which are part of the expansion packs.&#10;&#10;Additional material, which is generally missed since it is not technically an expansion, was published in the HeroQuest: Adventure Design Kit which did feature one more Heroquest adventure: A Plague of Zombies.&#10;&#10;",2,5,90,90,"['Dice Rolling', 'Die Icon Resolution', 'Grid Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Role Playing', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Square Grid', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers']",14,90,2.1374,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1851,15,72,172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995692948693092,0.0,0.0,0.1345633552864425,0.43438606273148106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1431527526919436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40369006585932754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13208549118068028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14564424128242998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11172550016145145,0.0,0.0,0.10590263034202842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10968317124465685,0.0,0.0,0.269126710572885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09807802686333233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10329650165296334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13861443545465046,0.0,0.0,0.1465126446652998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11207688765803926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1439651255822338,0.0,0.0,0.09018901509209737,0.2801349125297287,0.09371022582958999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14006745626486436,0.10902621758180181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09327851960512627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25201305250996997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1971372073480014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11539575227481719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13520907842045365,0.0,0.11989308666824183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14740148293289207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14831174103859063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11137735130536706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0867870680225599,0.0,0.0,0.10560402101237334,0.0
362,676,5782,Coloretto,2003,6.82693,"Game play in Coloretto is simple: Either draw a card to play to a row, or take a row of cards to add them to your collection. A row can have at most three cards, so at some point everyone is forced to take a row. Once all the rows have been claimed, players start a new round, drawing or taking once again.&#10;&#10;What are you trying to do with these cards? Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points. Jokers are highly-prized as they always match what you want, and +2 cards provide sure points, giving you a back-up plan if everything goes south in terms of the colors you're collecting.&#10;&#10;Once only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you. Each color is scored using a triangular number system: the first card in a color is &plusmn;1 point, the second card is &plusmn;2 points, and so on.

364,679,155703,Evolution,2014,6.82332,"In Evolution, players adapt their species in a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce and predators lurk.  Traits like Hard Shell and Horns will protect your species from Carnivores, while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach. With over 4,000 ways to evolve your species, every game becomes a different adventure.&#10;&#10;Evolution is played in a variable number of rounds. Each round, players draw 3 Trat cards to enhance their species, create new species or feed their existing animals. Play continues until the Trai deck has been finished and needs to be reshuffled.  Reshuffling the Trait cards signals the final round of the game.  At the end of the game the player with the most food, traits, and population wins.&#10;&#10;Evolution packs a surprising amount of variety for a game with simple rules.  The variety comes from the synergies between the trait cards and from the different personalities at the table.  Some players thrive on creating Carnivores to wreak havoc on their fellow players.  Others prefer to stay protected and mind their own business.  Evolution encourages both play styles by giving each of them multiple paths to victory.  And it is the mix of play styles at the table that ultimately determines the ecosystem in which the players are adapting.  So gather your friends and see who can best adapt to the changing world around them.&#10;&#10;",2,6,60,60,"['Action Points', 'Hand Management', 'Push Your Luck', 'Simulation', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Take That', 'Turn Order: Progressive']",12,60,2.4274,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Animals', 'Card Game', 'Educational', 'Environmental', 'Prehistoric', 'Print & Play']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1397,15,41,139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17712939774930353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1406954806001618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1402310634709484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18031749730927926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17044842706321428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1623206749596842,0.1154401794041664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2059290542435745,0.0,0.13499424517402886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10194441692226357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13417636337339922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18031749730927926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11625806120479604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14309027114147224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1371046171761494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1646125057360345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1792301738391489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11410841243414417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32614411849006353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12057981761186146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17319433075691754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22980571610926406,0.1416385565044508,0.0,0.13104234119279012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1580521855503271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1713457196333359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29019935939412383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3584603476782978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12274385054306372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17414712977863223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10616736408115279,0.0,0.0,0.12918630393574213,0.0

The round ends when each player's ships are full, or the commodity card deck is exhausted.  After each round, points are awarded to each player having the most of a given commodity, and to the one with the most valuable total &quot;cargo load&quot;.&#10;&#10;Part of the Knizia auction trilogy.&#10;One of the Knizia Florentine auction games.&#10;&#10; Related Games: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Medici vs Strozzi (two-player version)&#10;     Strozzi&#10;     Mercator, included in Neue Spiele im alten Rom (ancestor to Medici).&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,6,60,60,"['Auction / Bidding', 'Auction: Once Around', 'Income', 'Push Your Luck', 'Set Collection', 'Victory Points as a Resource']",10,60,2.2386,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Renaissance'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,933,9,67,94,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16543369875858385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14531508567347903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1630784122612321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22561337136806692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31813052097573324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22838378206621152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20432784243829874,0.0,0.2229689328454284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19403620259336632,0.20432784243829874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2072127789251736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28927742053966055,0.1782933730642602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21024830047062043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20157925414870326,0.0,0.0,0.2789869363130758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2204395069738155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16992957221775284,0.21345099717943858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1972685690958935,0.0,0.0,0.19325541732252802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17150888088501498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
366,683,30869,Thebes,2007,6.8209,"Thebes is a game of competitive archeology. Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition's handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.&#10;&#10;The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &quot;time&quot;. So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &quot;time&quot; to catch up.&#10;&#10;In addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt.  When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure. That dirt is then returned to the bag, making the first draw more likely to provide useful tiles.&#10;&#10;This is the new entry for the Queen printing of Jenseits von Theben.  As the new game changes several mechanisms of the original, and is available in a much wider release, the two games should be regarded as separate entities.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Jenseits von Theben&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,60,"['Point to Point Movement', 'Set Collection', 'Turn Order: Time Track']",8,60,2.1565,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Ancient', 'Exploration', 'Travel']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2334,15,98,198,0.0,0.0,0.10889853443405212,0.1662218136471532,0.07902147069595761,0.0,0.1136107377956223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18255502902997925,0.0,0.09446973992815909,0.0,0.0931517871405832,0.09347588324447731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20333766833849162,0.1184453307028547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11058001798603473,0.0,0.1184453307028547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1136107377956223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10082431078379221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08757878448370231,0.0,0.0,0.0898004375620339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08220239494503599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08197950471657499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10343278984374951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10679390921141231,0.0,0.09729334055027322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11698267000294403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11491436046933573,0.0,0.0,0.1487430411960673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10782775640762858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07402890432450777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1029819753690368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07822728921591834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20778097449515484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11627725868906279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33908090021130843,0.10389048724757742,0.0,0.0,0.0718925389214234,0.0,0.0,0.35579163256658813,0.4882520957522926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21889723175806625,0.0,0.11770508080558785,0.0,0.0,0.08757878448370231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06775098551173336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08197950471657499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

370,698,37904,Formula D,2008,6.8053,"Formula D is a high stakes Formula One type racing game where the players race simulated cars with the hope of crossing the finish line first.  This is a re-release of Formula D&#195;&#169; with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -&#10;&#10;The game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a &quot;stop&quot; rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners. &#10; Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car&rsquo;s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car&rsquo;s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.&#10;&#10;However, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.&#10;&#10;Formula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a &quot;Dashboard&quot; with movable pegs to manage your car&rsquo;s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with &quot;Character&quot; profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.  Finally, the old category of &quot;Fuel&quot; for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting.&#10;&#10;The popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula D&#195;&#169; Mini), and a lot of &quot;after market&quot; parts.  There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.

371,699,13004,The Downfall of Pompeii,2004,6.80443,"The year is AD 79. Pompeii, sitting at the foot of Vesuvius, is at the high point in its development. People come to the city from far and wide to try to make their luck in the city. So far nobody has dreamed of the danger that will bury all of their dreams under mountains of ash just ten years later. Who will survive the eruption of Vesuvius unscathed?&#10;&#10;The simple rules make it easy to get started with The Downfall of Pompeii, a game in which a lot of tactical know-how is required &ndash; along with a little luck &ndash; in order to bring your pieces out of the city at the right time.&#10;&#10;The game falls into two halves: before and after the eruption of Vesuvius. Before the eruption, players play cards to place their pieces in buildings. After the first eruption, they can also place as many relatives as the number of pieces already in the building they placed their piece in. When Omen cards are drawn, the player can take any opponent's piece and throw it into the erupting volcano. In this manner, players try to get as many pieces onto the board as close to the exits from the city as possible.&#10;&#10;After the second eruption, the game changes. Now each player places a lava tile, which kills any pieces on that square and may block exits from the city. Then they move two pieces toward the exits, moving them a number of squares equal to the pieces on the square from which they started. The player who gets the most pieces out of the city wins.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;The 2013 second edition of The Downfall of Pompeii includes three dual vent tiles and a new &quot;Dual Vent&quot; variant.&#10;&#10;",2,4,45,45,"['Events', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Move Through Deck', 'Square Grid', 'Take That', 'Tile Placement']",10,45,1.8438,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Ancient'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1648,16,79,151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692689241289011,0.09016670338486872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06480841989688596,0.07850891599017437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44595097048987775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07985693274656817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06963536558029426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11697367576243528,0.08444490319142414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08487146149737591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.072996412937846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09184792556355256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08487146149737591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09184792556355256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1733211150750386,0.0,0.11982693599199455,0.0,0.11100811388614014,0.0,0.05767107785002601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06709683416287929,0.08760953727673255,0.0,0.0,0.13927073116058852,0.0,0.0,0.11481079504951508,0.0,0.08910984978419594,0.07985693274656817,0.0,0.05904702825118665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08165991160314678,0.0,0.6722082483233668,0.11481079504951508,0.07432516174831295,0.08530599331581537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07351883437110747,0.06812108685106509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07573448871720263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06592447943387644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15767732602877518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08620021030784288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09127390194388652,0.05574876210186101,0.0,0.07632304611379091,0.0689742752842076,0.054087571613714316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1439710486120771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05341043319441176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

374,703,24508,Taluva,2006,6.80088,"In Taluva, players attempt to successfully settle a South Sea island slowly emerging from the ocean waters as volcano after volcano erupts.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players decide to either have a new volcano erupt along the shore, increasing the size of the island, or to have an existing volcano erupt again, increasing the height of the land around it (and possibly destroying parts of existing settlements). They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.&#10;Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.&#10;&#10;A lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...&#10;&#10;",2,4,45,45,"['Chaining', 'Layering', 'Pattern Building', 'Race', 'Static Capture', 'Sudden Death Ending', 'Team-Based Game', 'Tile Placement']",8,45,2.2539,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Abstract Strategy', 'Territory Building']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1998,18,78,167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07696468068156564,0.0,0.16731129271681858,0.0,0.0,0.14163105547469818,0.09131873779545333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2356424441562577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09131873779545333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06879180018293188,0.0,0.05131115550713812,0.06520653364547957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1724851076894731,0.09189304338879704,0.0,0.0,0.33462258543363715,0.0,0.2722748167410564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11539881443450103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06879180018293188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07989616031881996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11486719276732353,0.5205317039070028,0.0,0.24856068047400984,0.0,0.060690815243197305,0.0,0.0,0.07355494852285323,0.0681545495043929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.065956863062839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2573727726646401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062426129246227785,0.0,0.0,0.07758493596674068,0.0,0.0,0.06576699919391407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11155229436626354,0.0,0.22908161327759674,0.13801631408685167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1634000496806224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08534789759264161,0.16650229163757954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07105165357037505,0.0,0.0,0.061780026733220916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06857743742324797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05343666963444361,0.08285356015800327,0.0,0.0,0.0

Her workers then get busy and deliver the results of their effort: If you placed workers next to a cacao field, you receive one or two cacao markers per worker; if they're next to a market, you can choose to sell one cacao marker per worker at the listed price; if next to a well, you receive water; if next to a temple, they stand and look good until the end of the game; and so on. He then refills her hand from her personal deck to three worker tiles.&#10;&#10;Once all players have used all of their worker tiles, the game ends.

Gates to the beyond begin to leak open, and terrifying creatures of increasing strength steal through them. Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash. Only a handful of investigators race against time to locate the eldritch symbols necessary to seal the portals forever. Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.&#10;&#10;Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.&#10;&#10;To locate Elder Signs, investigators must successfully endure Adventures within the museum and its environs. A countdown mechanism makes an Ancient One appear if the investigators are not quick enough. The investigators must then battle the Ancient One. A clever and thematic dice mechanism pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy, all within the standard game duration of one to two hours.&#10;&#10;",1,8,90,90,"['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Die Icon Resolution', 'Modular Board', 'Re-rolling and Locking', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Variable Player Powers']",13,90,2.3448,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Card Game', 'Dice', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Horror', 'Novel-based']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1669,12,51,153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2390026615067458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2404038546776471,0.0,0.0,0.22426370960486855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23243338361904614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1924134908229617,0.0,0.36100221324272785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22998795363942814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2000863456980628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2276348263740166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23119868045911066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18859492187856672,0.2404038546776471,0.22536728659227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24330439961269879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29013792754495504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18499678103315884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18441677245938057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17050366669790248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1743125131298718,0.0

Japan, importing Western culture and eager to become one of the Grand Nations, saw the birth of many private railway companies and entered the Golden Age of railways. Eventually, as a result of the actions of powerful people and capitalists, many of these smaller companies gradually merged into larger ones.&#10;&#10;In Trains, the players are such capitalists, managing private railways companies and striving to become bigger and better than the competition. The game takes place during the 19th and 20th century in the 2012 OKAZU Brand edition, whereas the 2013 AEG/Pegasus edition is set in modern times, with bullet trains, freight trains and more. You will start with a small set of cards, but by building a more effective deck throughout the game, you will be able to place stations and lay rails over the maps of Osaka, Tokyo or other locations.

382,726,2398,Cribbage,1630,6.78572,"Cribbage is a card game invented in the early 17th century, based on the earlier game Noddy. It is played with a deck of standard playing cards and a signature piece of equipment called the cribbage board.  Cribbage is traditionally played as a 2 player game.&#10;&#10;In the version usually played today, each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, from which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from the draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then play cards in turn, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs along tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until both players have exhausted their hand of cards.&#10;&#10;Next, each player picks up their hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled and the deal alternates.  The winner is the first to reach 121 points.&#10;&#10;The origin date listed for this game is approximate.&#10;&#10;",2,6,30,30,['Hand Management'],10,30,1.9036,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Card Game'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1171,13,46,109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14698983519603223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13850329289091518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3425338619890092,0.0,0.0,0.15064279499763794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11096887234242017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16558866049165633,0.12976555681909763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12976555681909763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4459658340777331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17026870218310508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1674019454313708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1313809825777587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14817442040238893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3477283158265787,0.12179935602886816,0.0,0.0,0.2603278779511658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16648605086542018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11922360189856594,0.16648605086542018,0.3065128991353971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1605546781808982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12633231376903178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14757817906485027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14149898823159518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
383,741,113294,Escape: The Curse of the Temple,2012,6.77367,"Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose.&#10;&#10;The initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile &ndash; the safe room &ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice.  Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you &quot;discover&quot; magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile. The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.&#10;&#10;Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.&#10;&#10;Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the &quot;Treasures&quot; module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the &quot;Curses&quot; module, some tiles &quot;curse&quot; players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!&#10;&#10;",1,5,10,10,"['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Elapsed Real Time Ending', 'Grid Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Physical Removal', 'Push Your Luck', 'Re-rolling and Locking', 'Real-Time', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Tile Placement']",8,10,1.4764,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Action / Dexterity', 'Adventure', 'Dice', 'Electronic', 'Exploration', 'Real-time']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2519,25,120,197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05783091909557858,0.07348444879635396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08614105692106165,0.0,0.0,0.13634404468281305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08614105692106165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07440512143852347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08668279996307694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07671667620219509,0.0,0.0,0.08178714682582268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3175677753256972,0.07778710695798641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07040508157068721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22045334638906192,0.0,0.07815584636824137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06409348693917932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0712029687165675,0.060158840498173105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11013517786398755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06889141395289589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0712029687165675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08009866172165804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15557421391597281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05238275154953083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16536552019048137,0.0,0.0,0.13143875439572658,0.0,0.06489137408505961,0.05417716905316901,0.0,0.0840987015894943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10835433810633802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11449941373828737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17336559992615388,0.07147551232647853,0.0,0.0,0.2915658152829286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0588866303080746,0.15073225626954304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07603101169720744,0.0,0.0,0.05261369556050614,0.0,0.5762477746349693,0.1301909274569775,0.15313776947861815,0.0,0.07504109287932474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.258423170763185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04958274918534516,0.06509546372848875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06938445668976743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05040686404320579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
384,742,257501,KeyForge: Call of the Archons,2018,6.77263,"From the imagination of legendary game designer Richard Garfield comes a game unlike anything the world has ever seen&mdash;a game where every deck is as unique as the person who wields it and no two battles will ever be the same. This is KeyForge, where deckbuilding and boosters are a thing of the past, where you can carve a path of discovery with every deck, where you can throw yourself into the game with the force of a wild wormhole and embrace the thrill of a tactical battle where wits will win the day!&#10;&#10;Along with this new breed of game comes a new world: the Crucible, an artificial world built from the pieces of countless planets across the stars. Here, anything is possible. This world was built for the Archons, god-like beings who, for all their power, know little about their own origins. The Archons clash in constant struggles, leading motley companies of various factions as they seek to find and unlock the planet&rsquo;s hidden Vaults to gain ultimate knowledge and power.&#10;&#10;This starter set contains two starter decks, two unique Archon Decks, and all the keys and tokens two players need to play!&#10;&#10;KeyForge: Call of the Archons is the world's first Unique Deck Game. Every single Archon Deck that you'll use to play is truly unique and one-of-a kind, with its own Archon and its own mixture of cards in the deck. If you pick up an Archon Deck, you know that you're the only person in existence with access to this exact deck and its distinct combination of cards. In fact, in just the first set of KeyForge: Call of the Archons, there are more than 104 quadrillion possible decks!&#10;&#10;Every Archon Deck contains a full play experience with a deck that cannot be altered, meaning it's ready to play right out of the box. Not only does this remove the need for deckbuilding or boosters, it also creates a new form of gameplay with innovative mechanics that challenges you to use every card in your deck to find the strongest and most cunning combinations. It is not the cards themselves that are powerful, but rather the interactions between them&mdash;interactions that can only be found in your deck. Your ability to make tough tactical decisions will determine your success as you and your opponent trade blows in clashes that can shift in an instant!&#10;&#10;KeyForge: Call of the Archons is played over a series of turns in which you, as the Archon leading your company, use the creatures, technology, artifacts, and skills of a chosen House to reap precious &AElig;mber, hold off your enemy's forces, and forge enough keys to unlock the Crucible's Vaults. You begin your turn by declaring one of the three Houses within your deck, and for the remainder of the turn you may play and use cards only from that House. For example, if you take on the role of the Archon Radiant Argus the Supreme, you will find cards from Logos, Sanctum, and Untamed in your deck, but if you declare &quot;Sanctum&quot; at the start of your turn, you may use actions, artifacts, creatures, and upgrades only from Sanctum. Your allies from Logos and Untamed must wait.&#10;&#10;Next, you must strive to gain the advantage with a series of tactical decisions, leveraging both the cards in your hand and those in play to race ahead of your opponent. If you wish to weaken your rival&rsquo;s forces, you may send out your allies to fight enemies on the opposing side, matching strength against strength. Otherwise, you may choose to use your followers to reap, adding more &AElig;mber to your pool.&#10;&#10;Notably, no card in KeyForge has a cost &mdash; choosing a House at the start of a turn allows you to play and use any number of cards from that House for free, leading turns to fly by with a wave of activity! Yet balance is key. If you simply reap more &AElig;mber at every opportunity, your rival may quickly grow their team of minions and destroy yours, outpacing your collection and leaving your field barren.

The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 &amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 &amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 &amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn&rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn&rsquo;s progress lost.&#10;&#10;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,30,"['Dice Rolling', 'Push Your Luck', 'Race']",9,30,1.146,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Dice'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1089,6,52,111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4453071533722616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1252285905499081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15284124483200903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10981090237625964,0.15475225337827986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1339686561116026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12809581457110286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3401666456522788,0.0,0.08727509384095289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17282085009584108,0.10981090237625964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10169753667460486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12910017487370554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14601218781658534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09672090652592144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1437299167215323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13952933390850145,0.0,0.11477550122224106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26026193744507464,0.0,0.0,0.2552062600331569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12087211536933867,0.0,0.0,0.13118962521215882,0.30383920905964346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11075475300262498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18785936656442323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29687143558150775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15284124483200903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Some action spaces allow players to collect money, while others offer players a way to spend that money to acquire points.  Other action spaces allow players to engage in various set collections that score points for assembling those sets.  Some action spaces simply award players points for stopping on them, or give the player a randomly determined action from all of the other types.&#10;&#10;All of the actions in Tokaido are very simple, and combined with a unique graphic design, Tokaido offers players a peaceful zen mood in its play.&#10;&#10;",2,5,45,45,"['End Game Bonuses', 'Set Collection', 'Track Movement', 'Turn Order: Time Track', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Worker Placement']",8,45,1.7408,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Travel'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1586,9,58,147,0.0,0.0,0.0820206336278906,0.5633802463033025,0.17855312186819094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21983936187516462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06330346882688323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14180162012035596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05031209162997003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09962725977054462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0756278126335097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05680778022842663,0.0,0.08121414075212773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07442329239459584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08757817066828087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0727290429140546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1558078445219551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06763625265646082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057351888485534165,0.0,0.0796827472175888,0.0,0.07931559441195302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08285700331918133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12120842209484696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05588604408369024,0.08161378658400817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08372554886207409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5254690240096853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06384757708399076,0.07824865262183046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.329739784681136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06596293910698911,0.0,0.08082144563602969,0.06403189974056973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08757817066828087,0.06897799783906398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06678409869326493,0.08509441645038988,0.0,0.08810947518246477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
390,771,180593,The Bloody Inn,2015,6.75613,"France 1831: In a remote corner of Ard&egrave;che, the little village of Peyrebeille sees numerous travelers pass through. A family of greedy rural farmers is determined to make its fortune and has devised a diabolical stratagem to achieve this goal: Invest in an inn so they can rob traveling guests, getting rich without arousing the suspicions of the police! Whether or not their plan will work out, one thing is certain: Not every guest will leave this inn alive.&#10;&#10;The Bloody Inn is a card game in which you play one member of a family of greedy, murderous innkeepers. At the start of each round, cards are placed face up to fill the inn with guests. Each card carries a cost representing how many cards a player must discard from her hand in order to take an action related to that card. Certain guests have an affinity for particular actions, so those cards return to a player's hand after being discarded. Cards also show how much money, in francs, each guest possesses. A round has two phases in which players take one action each, in turn order. Players choose one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;     bribe a guest into becoming an accomplice (take a card from the inn to their hand)&#10;     build an annex (move a card from their hand to their player area; it now represents a structure under which a victim may be buried)&#10;     kill a guest (move a card from the inn to their player area, awaiting burial)&#10;     bury a victim (place an unburied victim card under an annex card and take the money from the victim's pockets)&#10;     launder money (players may only have a certain amount of cash on hand; excess must be converted to 10F checks by the local notary)&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, if any room of the inn contains one of the police, then they conduct an investigation; if a player has any unburied victims, then he must pay 10F per victim to the local gravedigger to hurredly &mdash; and quietly &mdash; bury the bodies! Lastly in the round, any cards (accomplices) in each player's hand must be paid 1F each. After the guest deck has been depleted the second time, players take a final round, then tally their francs. The player with the most money wins!&#10;&#10;",1,4,30,60,"['End Game Bonuses', 'Hand Management', 'Income', 'Open Drafting', 'Ownership', 'Simulation', 'Solo / Solitaire Game']",14,60,2.3614,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Economic', 'Horror', 'Post-Napoleonic']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2215,13,96,193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16326953082654228,0.15523592436717853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07841926726563027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29958925047702817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08255503233019153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11159288573354012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07356272010192047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10977089364494833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06496272482174693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08550210432863121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08602328863626756,0.2244523211269986,0.0,0.0,0.11490492870424775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09246284248279713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4434548959736365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11634161093621861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07589098328199949,0.0,0.07030568582394683,0.0,0.1461012006603796,0.1474708505154925,0.0,0.0,0.40638283747082804,0.0,0.16997996911380112,0.0,0.1059126164759767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14958696879846567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1142120462736565,0.0,0.07271406929972679,0.09414593740509174,0.0,0.0,0.11490492870424775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3661015960651967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09986308349234273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07903488853111763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06851145711302467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11490492870424775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06765374177492534,0.104897131546719,0.09903355977406741,0.0,0.0

392,776,156336,Onirim (Second Edition),2014,6.75366,"You are a Dreamwalker, lost in a mysterious labyrinth, and you must discover the oneiric doors before your dreamtime runs out &ndash; or you will remain trapped forever!&#10;&#10;You may wander through the chambers of dreams, hoping that chance will reveal the doors, or you can linger in each type of room. In both cases, you will have to deal with the slithering Nightmares, which haunt the hallways of the labyrinth.&#10;&#10;Onirim is a solo/cooperative card game. You (and a partner, if you wish) must work (together) against the game to gather the eight Door cards before the deck runs out; you can obtain those Door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row, or by discarding (under specific circumstances) one of your powerful Key cards. In both cases you will have to decide the best use of each card in your hand and carefully play around the Nightmares. Those cards are hidden in the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn...&#10;&#10;Seven mini-expansions, all standalone and compatible with one another, are included with the second edition of Onirim, including these three that were in the first edition of the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Towers&quot; introduces a new type of card that allows more searching and deck manipulation, while also imposing an additional victory condition.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions&quot; adds evil time bombs that will impede your progress at predictable moments of your quest as well as helpful but unreliable allies.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    In &quot;The Book of Steps Lost and Found&quot;, you must find the eight Door cards in a randomly given order and may remove discarded cards from the game to cast powerful spells that will help you complete this difficult task.&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to these three variants from the first edition, there are four new modules in the Onirim 2nd edition box. Just like previously, each module consists of something that makes the game easier and something that makes the game harder:&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Glyphs&quot; introduces a fourth symbol on location cards (apart from Key, Sun and Moon), which makes it easier to compose the row of unrepeated symbols. Player must then find one extra door of each color (so 12 doors in total) to win&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Dreamcatchers&quot; are four cards that &quot;guard&quot; the Limbo piles.

395,787,71721,Space Hulk: Death Angel – The Card Game,2010,6.74938,"A cooperative game where the players attempt to clean out an infestation of hostile aliens from a derelict spaceship. Set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, players take on the roles of Space Marines pitted against hordes of Genestealers.&#10;&#10;Players choose from six different combat teams, each consisting of two Space Marines with different abilities. Each player receives three Action cards for each of his combat teams. After all of the Space Marines have fallen into formation, prepare for the first wave of Genestealers.&#10;&#10;Game play is quick and easy to learn. Each game is played over a series of rounds, broken up into phases. During the Choose Actions Phase, each player must secretly determine which of the following Action cards they wish to play on their Space Marines: Support, Attack, or Move + Activate. You can't pick the same Action card next round, so choose wisely.&#10;&#10;Action resolution keeps all players involved while the overwhelming odds inspire them to work together to survive. The Action Resolution Phase consists of each player revealing and carrying out their chosen Action. The lowest number card goes first, which means Attacks are resolved after Supports.

During your turn, you take a pair of identical tiles from the central &quot;castle&quot; (known as the Dragon Castle) and place them on your own realm board to build your own castle. From time to time, you may sacrifice these tiles to acquire shrines in their place.&#10;&#10;Every time you create a set of tiles of the same kind, you &quot;consolidate&quot; them, i.e. flip them face down to score points. When you consolidate a set, you may also build shrines on top of the consolidated tiles: Shrines allow you to score more points, but they also limit your building options.

In 2008, Avalon Hill released a 50th anniversary edition with a new map and cardboard pieces representing the armies and navies.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player represents one of the seven &quot;Great Powers of Europe&quot; (Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I. Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: it can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold its position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of &quot;orders.&quot; The outcome of the various orders is basically determined by the total strength of the units involved. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance. With its incredibly simplistic movement mechanism fused to a significant negotiation element, this system is highly respected by many gamers.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 3&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Colonial Diplomacy&#10;    Diplomacy: Classical Variant&#10;    Diplomacy: Hundred Variant&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,7,360,360,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Negotiation', 'Player Elimination', ""Prisoner's Dilemma"", 'Simulation', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']",12,360,3.3364,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Bluffing', 'Negotiation', 'Political', 'Post-Napoleonic', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1580,11,91,148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20987460488031898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17481576084991687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15474481914072427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16011909785390419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20987460488031898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3523728760689023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1377646310157751,0.0,0.25525132096013764,0.39641638395345635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15428201554604162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3864177971729831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19320889858649154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13230216947049062,0.0,0.19320889858649154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19717022768804596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2025741670778055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16329548654710183,0.17759318978169827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20144878906355743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14943929609711615,0.0

401,800,143741,BANG! The Dice Game,2013,6.73899,"In the U.S. wild west, the eternal battle between the law and the outlaws keeps heating up. Suddenly, a rain of arrows darken the sky: It's an Indian attack! Are you bold enough to keep up with the Indians? Do you have the courage to challenge your fate? Can you expose and defeat the ruthless gunmen around you?&#10;&#10;BANG! The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang! card game in place. At the start of the game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies, outlaws, and renegades. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game.&#10;&#10;Each player also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game. The Sheriff reveals his role card and takes the first turn of the game. On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal his (or anyone else's) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine tokens in the center of the table.

Now your team stands in its shadow, ready to climb for fame and glory.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;K2 is a board game in which each player controls a team of 2 mountaineers, trying to climb to the summit of K2 and return before the other players' teams and before the mountain kills them. Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team.&nbsp;&#10;You can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers.&#10;K2 is a hand management game for 1-5 players, with strong interaction and low luck factor, lasting up to 60 minutes. The theme is very well represented by the mechanics, including such elements as changing weather, lack of oxygen and death of the mountaineers. The result is an exciting match for gamers and non-gamers alike.&#10;The box includes, among other materials, a double-sided board with two different routes to the summit (easier and harder) and two sets of weather tiles (for summer and winter).&#10;&#10;",1,5,60,60,"['Hand Management', 'Player Elimination', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game']",8,60,2.2483,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Exploration', 'Sports']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1408,14,62,139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1781986383728451,0.0,0.0,0.17128540477023657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19087351437703376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13544224653217146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12068919108130066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10764627664766648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2805546013761957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254351119600148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12125755319621306,0.0,0.0,0.16970132113245814,0.0,0.0,0.15169729516343938,0.17727841583473689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18412158383761687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1800933997536401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18412158383761687,0.0,0.0,0.1394371017272481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3276767022447444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11957214194992884,0.17461846574576584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4834612777389301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14333870083974998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16115375924631004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10918006332874687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14288930018003584,0.0,0.28488808304159935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

You are a world-renowned master city planner who has been asked to redesign two different cities. Projects of such significance require the expertise of more than one person, so for each assignment you are paired with a partner with whom to discuss and execute your grandiose plans. Will your planning and collaborative skills be enough to design the most impressive city in the world?&#10;&#10;Between Two Cities is a partnership-driven tile-drafting game in which each tile represents part of a city: factory, shop, park, landmarks, etc. You work with the player on your left to design the heart of one city, and with the player on your right to design the heart of another city.

Every 7 turns (each &quot;week&quot;), points are scored in the city and caravan, and after 3 weeks, the wise traders will see who among them has profited the most...&#10;&#10;",2,4,45,60,"['Action Drafting', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Dice Rolling']",8,60,2.3699,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Dice', 'Economic']",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1226,16,54,123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2757190002386725,0.2621523664027491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15670086659679233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33587389287631403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1834236514240205,0.47696266914814905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1439561139557489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17467718192362522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14439041139181386,0.0,0.0,0.17714347613758247,0.0,0.0,0.1940439952540169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17885836126057478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12630638820682374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15898755638271636,0.0,0.17714347613758247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17008375781863969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16200222121031244,0.0,0.0,0.16521151149318822,0.0,0.0,0.16200222121031244,0.0,0.0,0.1334689965693961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17008375781863969,0.0,0.12307815079461024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1452705536664569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13902048842656115,0.0
408,831,21882,Blue Moon City,2006,6.71876,"Blue Moon City - the board game - picks up where the two-player game, (Blue Moon), ended: the reconstruction of the destroyed city of Blue Moon. The board, illustrated by Franz Vohwinkel as well as many well-known American fantasy artists, consists of 21 large building tiles, which show building plans on one side and the buildings in their reconstructed glory on the other. As in the 2-player game, the game includes 3 large molded plastic dragons.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the board tiles all show their building plan sides. The object of the game is to use cards featuring the races of Blue Moon to help rebuild the city and, at the end, put the large Crystal of the Obelisk in the middle of the city back together. Whenever a building is completely rebuilt, its tile is turned back over to its rebuilt side. The players who helped with a building get crystals and dragon favors, which can be traded in for crystals at certain times.&#10;&#10;The player who first manages to add the required number of markers by paying crystals to the Obelisk wins the game. (four markers in a 4-player game, five markers in a 3-player game, and six markers in a 2-player game)&#10;&#10;There are two mini-expansions for this game (Blue Moon City: Expansion Tile Sets 1 & 2), each consisting of two tiles that can be added to the main game either separately or combined.  The first mini-expansion was included with the Der Knizia Almanach.  The second mini-expansion was included in the 6/06 issue of Spielbox.&#10;&#10;Rules changes&#10;&#10;     Original Knizia design--after dragon scales score, ALL players discard scales.  This rule was modified by the publisher. [citation needed]&#10;     In original printings such as Kosmos and FFG for 4-3-2 players the game uses 15-12-9 dragon scales.

415,850,1465,Wizard,1984,6.70737,"The trick-taking game Wizard uses a sixty-card deck that consists of the traditional 52-card deck (1-13 in four suits) along with four Wizards (high) and four Jesters (low).&#10;&#10;Players compete over multiple rounds based on the number of players, and whoever ends with the highest score wins. In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose &quot;no trump&quot;. On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.&#10;&#10;The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.&#10;&#10;After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.&#10;&#10;After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.&#10;&#10;A common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.&#10;&#10;",3,6,45,45,"['Betting and Bluffing', 'Hand Management', 'Predictive Bid', 'Trick-taking']",10,45,1.7124,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Fantasy']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2363,21,109,163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06990273721146427,0.0,0.07127510216361516,0.0,0.07747144128913433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06715999332628388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08404900883515072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06038617072350105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07903859363145933,0.0,0.07531575934208547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16142580953245395,0.0,0.0,0.08304702150051566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06038617072350105,0.0,0.08256298217616186,0.06536404990369059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16777363664902914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05406200425862899,0.0,0.07863598670452952,0.22698116456908118,0.07214255537277355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06937737352079903,0.0,0.07747144128913433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07636664305064268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10285238893777396,0.0,0.05343400515367286,0.10786986213451796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08354218913483674,0.0,0.0,0.06370639808594511,0.15956353279004046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39342992304802077,0.05906028490230222,0.0,0.0,0.06311625586987303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5355814868733126,0.06602010600569688,0.0,0.061081032384786016,0.0,0.17343391931084737,0.0,0.0,0.14609283137639725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05781130643694912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14928523139948843,0.0,0.0,0.051652921230435786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07566038818969373,0.08162636315714061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06811743288193124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08404900883515072,0.2885702214910942,0.058900144064512175,0.06861260051625233,0.15273328610128536,0.24743194240202768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

As players excavate their mountainous player board, new building and room tiles are added to the pool; some rooms can be used immediately when acquired, whereas others require the use of an action tile.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, players tally their points for buildings constructed and gold collected to see who wins.&#10;&#10;",1,2,20,40,"['Tile Placement', 'Worker Placement']",10,40,2.5508,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Fantasy', 'Farming']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1155,9,46,107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2673019056294624,0.16943295418903398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10127808921124361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1791978524979182,0.21708026780721923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21618125655873272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3556482616048455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2816715263966385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16689532505274357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12112192338052313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07936410095010005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11341904681683922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12391839318282087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29553517896850734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10992764987103366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10945845718447358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11503985048816268,0.0,0.2152946458613514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17252597557449842,0.22080758762555946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113777813261812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21103625086758343,0.38143321587521495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07263373816869907,0.09535830396880374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09476311791796627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0738409835068514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

419,862,15512,Incan Gold,2005,6.69936,"Diamant &mdash; also published as Incan Gold &mdash; is a quick, fun press-your-luck game. Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.&#10;&#10;Why would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper &mdash; but at the risk of ending up with nothing.&#10;&#10;All editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once. When an artifact card is revealed, no one can take this card and it's placed on the path. If exactly one player leaves at the end of a turn, they collect not only all gems that remain on the path, but the artifact as well, which is worth points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",3,8,30,30,"['Move Through Deck', 'Push Your Luck', 'Score-and-Reset Game', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']",8,30,1.1077,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Bluffing', 'Exploration']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1406,12,59,144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13061858819738537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15764284112397983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3117574060777976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12303448547266453,0.0,0.18354052663372405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32870235353029903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13500131171033536,0.11406156968756415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16038652109272944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10465539174751994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3135341480808574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15264515012778646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15186760599421745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15506898520598827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3124893272373457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12303448547266453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16134282527789498,0.0,0.0,0.2659924592013363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20687087842337268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28214522998758734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16332402828243472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09678341659368683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24606897094532906,0.0,0.12265109658369701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1542452473975002
420,868,251678,Railroad Ink: Blazing Red Edition,2018,6.69766,"In the multiplayer puzzle game Railroad Ink, your goal is to connect as many exits on your board as possible. Each round, a set of dice are rolled in the middle of the table, determining which kind of road and railway routes are available to all players. You have to draw these routes on your erasable boards to create transport lines and connect your exits, trying to optimize the available symbols better than your opponents.&#10;&#10;The more exits you connect, the more points you score at the end of the game, but you lose points for each incomplete route, so plan carefully! Will you press your luck and try to stretch your transportation network to the next exit, or will you play it safe and start a new, simpler to manage route?&#10;&#10;Railroad Ink comes in two versions, each one including two expansions with additional dice sets that add special rules to your games. The Blazing Red Edition includes the Lava and  Meteor expansions. Try to confine the lava coming from the erupting volcano before it destroys your routes, or deal with the havoc brought by the meteor strikes and mine the craters for precious ore. These special rules can spice up things and make each game play and feel different.&#10;&#10;Each box allows you to play from 1 to 6 players, and if you combine more boxes, you can play with up to 12 players (or more). The only limit to the number of players is the number of boards you have!&#10;&#10;",1,6,20,30,"['Bingo', 'Connections', 'Dice Rolling', 'Line Drawing', 'Network and Route Building', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game']",8,30,1.4679,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Dice', 'Trains']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1430,11,50,138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14511477377104776,0.0,0.15433970248647816,0.0,0.0,0.16238597038448366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27305736183181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15981142747689758,0.0,0.0,0.15361152751917445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17117846173607035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15981142747689758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1521908956349594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2508491340859046,0.0,0.09653892583422855,0.0,0.1265697982324403,0.0,0.0,0.12978055507868583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09558247660217338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11847765908538267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13604459330227855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13604459330227855,0.1589861569879964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15361152751917445,0.16151068019710857,0.0,0.11166169759306875,0.0,0.1034438070248181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12814544062434444,0.21397473232721614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1422444932600017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16906460881196786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269583693633455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10773223363378923,0.0,0.0,0.24572903331243598,0.0,0.11628746184076375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10723423515451672,0.15660067063065203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2464422124936385,0.0,0.11628746184076375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13604459330227855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26832116767723696,0.1445253035802414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17117846173607035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

At the beginning of each round, one player is chosen to be the captain of the trip and he rolls 2-4 dice to discover the challenges that they will face: fog, lightning bolts, killer birds, or pirates. He must then play the appropriate cards &mdash; a compass, a lightning arrester, a foghorn, or even cannons &mdash; to continue on the journey and reach the next city. But before the captain plays the appropriate cards, each player must decide whether to stay within the aircraft:&#10;&#10;&#10;     If you exit, you're guaranteed the victory points that come from exploring the current city.&#10;     If you stay on board, you hope to make it to the next city in order to catch more precious treasures.

Maybe it's the lights, maybe it's the energy, or maybe it's the giant monsters trying to demolish the place!&#10;&#10;King of New York is a standalone game from designer Richard Garfield that keeps the core ideas of King of Tokyo while introducing new ways to play. As in KoT, your goal is to be the first monster to collect 20 victory points (VPs) or to be the last monster standing. On your turn, you roll six dice up to three times, then carry out the actions on those dice. Claws cause damage to other monsters, hearts heal damage to yourself, and energy is stored up so that you can purchase power cards that provide unique effects not available to anyone else.&#10;&#10;What's new in King of New York is that you can now try to become a star in the big city; more specifically, you can achieve &quot;Fame&quot;, which nets you VPs, but superstar status is fleeting, so enjoy your time in the spotlight.&#10;&#10;The game board for King of New York is larger than in KoT with each monster occupying a district in the city and everyone trying to shine in Manhattan. When you attack, you can displace a monster in another district, whether to escape military forces or to find new smashing opportunities. Yes, smashing because you can now destroy buildings and get bonuses for doing so, but the more destruction you cause, the more intense the military response.&#10;&#10;The monsters from King of New York can be used in KoT and vice versa, but the power cards are specific to this game.&#10;&#10;Part of the King of Tokyo series.&#10;&#10;",2,6,40,40,"['Dice Rolling', 'Die Icon Resolution', 'King of the Hill', 'Open Drafting', 'Player Elimination', 'Push Your Luck', 'Re-rolling and Locking', 'Tags', 'Take That']",10,40,1.8714,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Dice', 'Fighting', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Science Fiction']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1610,12,77,152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10587238105056623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14446682925125662,0.0,0.11423297860994987,0.0,0.0,0.12656985772771243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12841685453862695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13564542353551415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3852505636158808,0.0,0.1261210809580739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2325514243555111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15578740981434902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13452965448119986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13035289692410104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10105185883146847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261210809580739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12937321169647137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44680265503300703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13398318206467486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09918337761082868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2617036974393142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13344404507014515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12748274027379106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12394946544554789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1586921766374371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09632109106988525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09345093441957528,0.14663844476378265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12437449695701701,0.2679663641293497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11390239976419522,0.0,0.11917174840565142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10668932656341987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15136921252536586,0.0,0.15673251466702845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Each mushroom card has two values: one for selling and one for cooking. Selling two or more like mushrooms grants foraging sticks that expand your options in the forest (that is, the running tableau of eight face-up cards on the table), enabling offensive or defensive plays that change with every game played. Cooking sets of three or more like mushrooms &ndash; sizzling in butter or cider if the set is large enough &ndash; earns points toward winning the game. With poisonous mushrooms wielding their wrath and a hand-size limit to manage, card selection is a tricky proposition at every turn.&#10;&#10;Following each turn, one card from the forest moves into a decay pile that is available for only a short time.

431,921,163602,XCOM: The Board Game,2015,6.66771,"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;You are humanity's last hope.&#10;&#10;In XCOM: The Board Game, you and up to three friends assume the roles of the leaders of the elite, international organization known as XCOM. It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.&#10;&#10;Where the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base &mdash; all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.&#10;&#10;One of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.&#10;&#10;The app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.&#10;&#10;The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world&rsquo;s crises before you know how many troops you&rsquo;ll need to commit to your base defense.&#10;&#10;The effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other.

Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you mark off the 2 or 12 in a row and have at least five numbers marked in that row, you get to also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.&#10;&#10;When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box.

434,943,65244,Forbidden Island,2010,6.65478,"Forbidden Island is a visually stunning cooperative board game. Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.&#10;&#10;What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.&#10;&#10;With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.&#10; For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Dare to discover Forbidden Island!

437,947,137269,Spyrium,2013,6.65293,"Spyrium is set in an alternate world, an England set in a steampunk-based universe. Players build factories, needing workers to manage the production of a commodity previously unknown to us called &quot;Spyrium&quot;. Producing Spyrium in one factory, then processing it in the next results in victory points (VPs) for that particular player. Alternatively, Spyrium can be purchased, but the material is rare and expensive, and players are constantly scraping for money.&#10;&#10;Only those who from the beginning of the game manage to increase their regular income or their base of permanently employed workers (who can be used again and again to raise money) will be flexible enough to get their hands on the important end-of-game buildings to generate many VPs.&#10;&#10;The circular nature of the game is flexible as each player can decide for himself when to move out of the placement phase and into the activation phase. With the two tracks in the game, those involved with delivery during the worker phase can then be used to raise money, to purchase an adjacent card, or to work on their own in an idle factory. All of these things are important, but in the end only the player who has dealt best with the lack of money, workers, and Spyrium will win.&#10;&#10;",2,5,75,75,"['Auction: Dutch Priority', 'Events', 'Income', 'Worker Placement']",12,75,2.8905,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['City Building', 'Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing', 'Science Fiction']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1269,8,49,119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15109798445254702,0.0,0.0,0.18909525152164414,0.0,0.14705743266115112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1290520018153861,0.0,0.16365401611592928,0.0,0.0,0.18684095905954104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2138140274438111,0.0,0.15550634483408282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12191743814652146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19145955208798848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11569974842854111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6687708328283823,0.0,0.13986521455466208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1433280122699281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2398785270408298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28755758544313537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1287189520569134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1325147995306521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16297626312237357,0.13547502045229204,0.0

It is a popular gambling game, but wagering real stakes is by no means necessary to have fun playing.&#10;&#10;The tiles consist of three suits numbering 1-9 (Dots, Numbers or Characters, and Bamboo, the &quot;Ace&quot; of which almost always looks like a bird), three different dragons (Red, Green, and White [white is unusual in that it may look like a silvery dragon, or like a picture frame, or blank - think &quot;White dragon in a snowstorm&quot;), and the four winds (east, south, west, and north).  There are four copies of each tile.  This totals to 136 tiles. In addition, special Flower, Season, and Joker (American version) tiles may also be used.&#10;&#10;Four players take turns drawing from a stock (the wall), or from the other players' discards, in an attempt to form sets of numeric sequences (e.g., 5-6-7 of the same suit, which can only be drawn from the player at one's left, by calling &quot;Chow&quot;), triplets and quadruplets (which can be drawn from the discards out-of-turn by calling &quot;Pung&quot;), pairs, and other patterns. &quot;Pung&quot; takes precedence over &quot;Chow&quot;, and &quot;Mah Jongg&quot; takes precedence over all (and is the only situation one may draw &quot;Chow&quot; out-of-turn.)

Precedence goes to the player who would play next in normal sequence.&#10;&#10;Originating in China in the mid-19th century, it was introduced to the U.S. in the 1920s.  It is now played in different forms throughout Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

440,965,53953,Thunderstone,2009,6.63775,"For ages the vile Doom Knights have sought to gather the remaining Thunderstones to fulfill a prophecy of corruption over the lands. Now the first Thunderstone has been discovered in the Dungeons of Grimhold and the Doom Knights have sent their minions to claim the relic. The Villagers of Barrowsdale gather brave souls to face the dungeon and keep the Thunderstone out of the hands of the Doom Knights.&#10;&#10;Thunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomnly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&#10;&#10;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types, so players will have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.&#10;&#10;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. Players may on their turn choose to attack a monster in the deck rather than visit town and buy cards. If they do this they play cards from their hand and resolve their abilities in order to boost strength and have enough light to reach a specific monster. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards.

It's time to let the guns talk and soon everyone is aiming at everyone. The richest surviving gangster wins the game!&#10;&#10;Ca$h 'n Guns helps you relive the best scenes of your favorite gangster movies. The goal is to have more money than anyone else after eight rounds while still being alive.&#10;&#10;Each round, one player is the Boss, and he controls the pace of play. First, loot cards are revealed on the table to show what's up for grabs. Next, players load their guns by secretly selecting either a &quot;Bang!&quot; or a &quot;Click! Click!&quot; card from their hand. The Boss counts to three, and on &quot;Three&quot; each player points his foam gun at someone else; due to his status, the Boss can tell one player who's pointing a gun at him that he needs to point it in another direction. After a pause to observe threats and measure the seriousness in an opponent's eyes, the Boss counts to three again and anyone who doesn't want to risk getting shot can chicken out and remove themselves from the round.&#10;&#10;Everyone who's pointing a gun at someone still in the round now reveals their card, and anyone who's the target of a &quot;Bang!&quot; takes a wound marker and gets none of the available loot. Starting with the Boss, everyone still in the round takes one loot card at a time from the table &mdash; money, diamonds, paintings, the position of Boss, medical care (to remove a wound), or a new bullet (to add a &quot;Bang!&quot; card to your hand) &mdash; until everything has been claimed.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, the game ends.

444,975,29368,Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game,2007,6.63187,"Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game is a survival horror board game that pits small-town heroes head-to-head against a horde of zombies. A team of four heroes is chosen by one set of players, and the zombies are controlled by one or two players. Each hero has its own special abilities. The board is modular, which changes the layout of the town and start positions of each hero. The game comes with several scenarios, which include simple survival, rescue, or escape. Differing combinations of heroes, scenarios, and board configurations offer a lot of replayability.&#10;&#10;A hero deck and a zombie deck deliver tactical bonuses to each side. Combat is resolved using six-sided dice, modified by the weapon cards with which heroes may be equipped. Many of the cards include zombie movie tropes to achieve a feel of playing out a horror movie. All the game art is photographic, enhancing the cinematic feel. The game also comes with a CD soundtrack of original thematic music.&#10;&#10;Each hero has its own plastic sculpted miniature. The game also has 14 zombies in two colors. Other objects and effects are represented by high-quality cardboard counters.&#10;&#10;",2,6,60,90,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Modular Board', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers']",12,90,2.2976,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,"['Fighting', 'Horror', 'Miniatures', 'Zombies']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1171,14,47,112,0.19608117729071659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2255239308197127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21278683718736888,0.21754628174230786,0.0,0.42109621676667797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2851972508489768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16524416152599866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14820610184896887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20839388036105563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1838575527968148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13628498435254335,0.0,0.14160590009567622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19608117729071659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15651615070675123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14127879164949905,0.0,0.0,0.19781101475099516,0.19440222485065248,0.0,0.21165649792122226,0.0,0.0,0.1761496455754554,0.20431498357129704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16234114945829328,0.0,0.15320622252005073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1904089698888807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1755519409764357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
445,979,166384,Spyfall,2014,6.62972,"Spyfall is a party game unlike any other, one in which you get to be a spy and try to understand what's going on around you. It's really simple!&#10;&#10;Spyfall is played over several rounds, and at the start of each round all players receive cards showing the same location &mdash; a casino, a traveling circus, a pirate ship, or even a space station &mdash; except that one player receives a card that says &quot;Spy&quot; instead of the location. Players then start asking each other questions &mdash; &quot;Why are you dressed so strangely?&quot; or &quot;When was the last time we got a payday?&quot; or anything else you can come up with &mdash; trying to guess who among them is the spy. The spy doesn't know where he is, so he has to listen carefully.

448,1001,112,Condottiere,1995,6.61675,"It is 13th century Italy. Trade is flourishing between the city-states and the Levant. Venice, Florence, and Genoa are all bursting with wealth. However, each city-state is also plagued with a weak national army, leaving them defenseless against invasion from their envious neighbors. Enter the Condottiere. &#10; As veteran English soldiers returned from the Crusades, Italy found itself with an influx of desperate and capable men. These hired swords were contracted to fight for individual city-states by an agreement known as a condotta. The most elite of these men were the mercenary leaders known as the Condottiere.&#10;&#10;The object of Condottiere is to acquire four connected provinces in renaissance Italy. To do this players auction off different provinces on the board and bid on these provinces with a hand of cards representing mercenaries, seasons, scarecrows, and political figures.

Designed for 1-5 players, this boardgame features multiple scenarios, challenging quests, and cooperative gameplay.&#10;&#10;Each player selects a hero; a ranger, rogue, warrior, cleric, or wizard. On their turn, each player can explore further into the dungeon (turn over new tiles), move through the already explored parts of the dungeon, and fight monsters. When a new dungeon tile is revealed, there is typically an encounter of some sort, and new monsters to fight are added. Slain monsters reward the players with treasure, and experience points, allowing them to level up and increase their skills during play. Players must cooperate to stay alive, slay the monsters, and achieve the goal of their quest. Each scenario has a different goal - from retrieving a relic, to slaying a vampire lord.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Dungeon Command: Blood of Gruumsh&#10;    Dungeon Command: Curse of Undeath&#10;    Dungeon Command: Sting of Lolth&#10;    Dungeon Command: Tyranny of Goblins&#10;    Dungeon Command: Heart of Cormyr&#10;&#10;&#10;Can also integrate with:&#10;&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: The Legend of Drizzt Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of Ashardalon Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Temple of Elemental Evil Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Tomb of Annihilation Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Waterdeep &#226;&#128;&#147; Dungeon of the Mad Mage Board Game&#10;    Dungeons & Dragons: Ghosts of Saltmarsh Board Game&#10;&#10;&#10;",1,5,60,60,"['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Role Playing', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Variable Player Powers']",12,60,2.5016,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Horror', 'Miniatures']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1840,9,143,152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1828295334875423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17572017952930774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1050322948207165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1850745816974037,0.1862385198991411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1729735520555722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17667247660760677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29602723894040067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1862385198991411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18393869294733506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6991469642553526,0.13605114114162944,0.0,0.0,0.1828295334875423,0.1411984793204292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15475897855298848,0.1398579974586187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1850745816974037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

454,1024,38054,Snow Tails,2008,6.60277,"Snow Tails is set in the snowy world of the Arctic Circle, where brave sledders compete in a test of skill and endurance. Action is fast and furious and not all sleds may make it to the finish. Huskies only have one setting and that is full speed! Hang on to your furs, the reins, your sled and anything else you can get hold of.&#10;&#10;The game contains modular track pieces which can be fitted together to form different courses. Players have their own Dog Decks which they draw from and play onto their sled mat. Movement is rarely in a straight line as the sled may drift left or right. Losing control or speeding into a corner results in Dent cards being acquired which will limit a player's hand size.&#10;&#10;The game features a fun and original movement mechanism.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary &#10;Race courses are built randomly. Players each have a dog sled with 2 dogs (initially valued 3 each) and a brake (also 3). Each player has the same deck of cards (5 sets of cards 1-5, shuffled) from which they draw a hand of 5 cards.&#10;&#10;On your turn, may play 1-3 cards of the same value to these 3 locations (dog1, dog2, brakes).

457,1036,201921,Tiny Epic Quest,2017,6.59763,"A world of peace has been torn asunder by the opening of a vile portal from the goblin kingdom. Nasty goblins pour into the peaceful groves and villages of the elf world, setting the realm ablaze. Now you, the heroes, must quest in order to right this wrong. There are two paths to victory: closing the portal or slaying all the goblins. Which one will you choose? Either way, your quests will be aided by the help of the surviving mushroom folk &mdash; and by the epic items that have been lost in the realm's deep dungeons. The world is ending quickly, so you must act fast to save it, but you also need to know when your luck will run out...&#10;&#10;In Tiny Epic Quest, players embark on a sandbox adventure. Each player controls a band of three elf heroes questing to save the world and the sacred mushroom folk from the intruding goblins.&#10;&#10;Each round is broken into two phases: day and night. During the day, players travel far and wide, visiting villages to acquire quests, monuments to learn powerful spells, mushroom groves to seek guidance, and treacherous locations in search of artifacts! Acquiring artifacts empower the heroes with unique abilities; this may improve a heroes' movement or combat, or their ability to learn spells or mitigate harmful dice rolls.&#10;&#10;Heroes must travel by foot, by horse, by raft, by boat and by gryphon to get to everywhere they need to go to satisfy their quests &mdash; or to position themselves for what night brings. As each type of movement is different, and limited, players need to take careful consideration when traveling, and how they travel, if they wish to accomplish all of their goals.&#10;&#10;During the night, players must face the challenge of their quests, and decisions, by rolling dice, hoping for fortune, and knowing when to quit. Will you press on? Or is it time to save your progress and rest? Tomorrow is another day.&#10;&#10;The game ends once the portal is closed or all the goblins have been eradicated. The player who has acquired the most victory points by slaying goblins, learning spells, and completing quests is crowned the winner!&#10;&#10;&#10;For a deluxe edition of this game, see Tiny Epic Quest: Deluxe Edition&#10;&#10;",1,4,30,60,"['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Modular Board', 'Push Your Luck']",14,60,2.6757,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Video Game Theme']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2221,22,105,196,0.1362991303817575,0.0,0.1441298391298085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15209193010931038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11284590291669923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11123931107104977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15121986428763248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22972766512171094,0.0,0.08841035910317509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2377060937847693,0.0,0.11735560889176563,0.0,0.0,0.11123931107104977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11591263541259479,0.0,0.14485788520118534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09982483508711243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13689579422168346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12286427772183085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15389575880342862,0.0,0.1567652544508554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14791149903349807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09843250283708128,0.1987105492102845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3612276681722351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10078096322337987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13571130633191927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1292629781414357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09866119164103475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14953120954273036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13571130633191927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0951515107455674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09231620501636542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1455995403955372,0.0,0.11251933812964487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21078769956148274,0.0,0.0,0.11735560889176563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12639348249400892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4437026164811714,0.0

460,1046,11971,Cockroach Poker,2004,6.5932,"Cockroach Poker is a reverse set collection game that has nothing to do with poker &ndash; except that the game is all about bluffing, with cards that show cockroaches, rats and stink bugs. The goal is to force another player to collect 4 of any one type of critter.&#10;&#10;The deck includes 64 cards, with eight copies of eight types of critters. To set up the game, shuffle the deck and deal the cards out to players.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player takes one card from their hand, lays it face down on the table, slides it to a player of their choice, and declares a type of critter, e.g., &quot;Stink bug&quot;. The player receiving the card either&#10;&#10;&#10;     Accepts the card, says either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, then reveals the card.

461,1066,66056,Rivals for Catan,2010,6.57974,"The Rivals for Catan is a reimplementation of Catan Card Game.&#10;&#10;The Rivals for Catan was released in German in September of 2010, on the 15th anniversary of the original card game. An English edition was released in the fourth quarter of 2010. The designer of the game, Klaus Teuber, has stated that he completely reworked many of the original card game's mechanics to make it easier for newcomers to play the game.&#10;&#10;Each player portrays a prince for Catan, developing their individual provinces and competing to build a more successful province than the other.  The basic mode of play is similar to the original Catan Card Game, where players expand their provinces by building settlements connected by roads.  Players may also build expansions in their settlements that aid them in various ways, or upgrade their settlements to cities to allow more expansions to be built.  They build these additions by using resources that they accumulate each turn, which are determined by the roll of a die.  Cards are drawn on each turn to replenish the players' hands.  The players may also use action cards that directly affect either their own province or their opponent's province.&#10;&#10;The Rivals for Catan features a reduced pool of cards, without the more aggressive style of action cards found in the original Catan Card Game.  Therefore, all action cards will be able to be used from the beginning of the game unlike in the original card game.&#10;&#10;Ways to Play:&#10;The Introductory Game focuses on the basics of the card game, featuring gameplay that is more appropriate for newcomers.  This game is played to 7 victory points and includes 36 Expansion Cards in four stacks.  This play style should take beginner players 25 to 30 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;Three Theme Games add more rules, expansions, and aggressive cards.  These Theme Games may be played individually or combined to play a variant called &quot;The Duel of the Princes.&quot;  Each Theme Game adds 24 Expansion and Event Cards to the cards from the Introductory Game, which are placed in two stacks separately from the cards from the Introductory Game.  When playing a Theme Game, playtime should be around 45 to 60 minutes.&#10;&#10;As with the original Catan Card Game, players can also play the Tournament Game, in which each player chooses specific cards to build their deck ahead of time from which they draw from during the game.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;The theme of The Rivals for Catan is no longer restricted only to the feudal era of the Middle Ages like the original Catan Card Game.  The Introductory Game portrays the very early years of the world of Catan, while each Theme Game takes place in progressively later eras.  These eras are known as &quot;The Era of Gold,&quot; &quot;The Era of Turmoil,&quot; and &quot;The Era of Progress.&quot;&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;",2,2,45,60,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Race']",10,60,2.3231,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'City Building', 'Medieval', 'Territory Building']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2893,24,124,204,0.0,0.09567659450818315,0.0,0.2157288995658592,0.0,0.0868779384956458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08418062921052039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07897558621367179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10121632900954845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2763087866030702,0.07231178437150673,0.0,0.09942677592239446,0.0,0.10000968206473157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09567659450818315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0647992089167717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09196481166754661,0.0,0.0,0.07577535257432289,0.0,0.0,0.07769758232780541,0.0,0.07671866495567252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18480151719371982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09518251801332434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06734734032578164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09721793295751677,0.14186143163297368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09775276080673231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08144776374201673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09885668194713076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09469767713605026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07695995257203025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06685010659986632,0.0,0.06193018443895075,0.0,0.19304429359327,0.0,0.0,0.19771336389426153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08910257819165286,0.0,0.0,0.62371804734157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0640516577039761,0.08293035192452848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13536841042530878,0.07112356601127513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08087766976675302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08617686252836093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07355705862310898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08232711004480107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09885668194713076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1024818595930765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07334531678020756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06220322097811094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060349701812391646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058619845487405745,0.07695995257203025,0.07977374862635457,0.0,0.0,0.07923892077713902,0.0,0.0,0.06889892631526806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19550552161346463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09240075859685991,0.0,0.07251522252585474,0.0

Each turn, a player moves one penguin in a straight line over hex-shaped ice tiles with 1, 2 or 3 fish on them.

Holmes, Watson and a dog are turning around the grid, a system already used by Bruno Cathala in several games, and can &ldquo;look&rdquo; at the streets in a row or column. Every round, like in Mr.Jack, four actions are available. The first player selects one, his opponent two, and the first player then uses the last remaining action. Actions allow moving a detective one or two spaces clockwise around the grid, turning a card in order to change the view of the streets, swapping two street cards or drawing an alibi card. At the end of the round, Mr.Jack states if he can be seen by one of the detectives.

Each board has several garden elements that are worth points when not planted over, and these are scored on two different tracks as soon as a garden has been finished. Crossing over a line on each track awards bonus tokens that can fill in empty spaces or give you a better selection of the flower bed tiles.

These cards may give from one to eight points, or entitle a player to perform the saloon or general store action twice in a row, place a die with a result of a player's choice under the cup without rolling, or steal 4 dollars from another player. There are many more cards of this kind that spice up the game.&#10;&#10;Queens: The player with the most Q's in his roll wins the favor of the girls, and takes advantage of their charm to steal from an opponent.

Having aces in the best poker hand permits taking additional cards.&#10;&#10;Finally, if a player did not win anything during a turn, he might visit Doc Badluck where he can choose any one of the following:&#10;- equip oneself with barbed wire - the player has two property claims that cannot be stolen;&#10;- draw the first card from the general store pile;&#10;- all other players must give the player two dollars;&#10;- an ace will bring a nugget from every other player.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no more gold nuggets in the mine or when all property claims have been issued. Players count their points: 1 for each nugget, 1 for every two dollars, 5 for whomever is currently sheriff, and each general store and property card for its value.&#10;&#10;",2,5,45,45,"['Catch the Leader', 'Dice Rolling', 'Re-rolling and Locking', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']",10,45,1.6877,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['American West', 'Dice', 'Party Game']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2651,21,148,205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14009652692080937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18001795851625682,0.0,0.08200162664901997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07186100412047434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0785110062784213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15335475062316428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09859635999475387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07083791599537546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09982913251494804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08361152295525533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2925841393122524,0.35833726699049817,0.0,0.0,0.07381391929796753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18640004132754118,0.0,0.0,0.055742501866487076,0.07083791599537546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14673341437586365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20784763053094277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18356563589616637,0.18176067083997352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19044489143787105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25367660643690887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08200162664901997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09685312921235599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1809813935923796,0.0,0.3134122865402388,0.0,0.08795363325420408,0.0,0.08717613115207065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17359234348473834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17833334754898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062393690455284284,0.0,0.0927187332625307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07990731868733922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09742094691939415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16789237555262715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07933950098030106,0.07144678460437348,0.08756189169245962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0864218415684264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08568941855871148,0.0,0.07718783357378589,0.0,0.0,0.1342309765372214,0.07990731868733922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06909468521297756,0.0,0.0,0.11610316031267107,0.09000897925812841,0.0,0.0,0.09369065403315784

471,1124,823,The Lord of the Rings,2000,6.55099,"The Lord of the Rings is a co-operative game in which the object is to destroy the Ring while surviving the corrupting influence of Sauron. Each player plays one of the Hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, you make your way across four conflict game boards, representing some of the most memorable conflicts from the entire trilogy: Moria, Helm's Deep, Shelob's Lair, and Mordor. Each conflict board tests your small Fellowship to the utmost as you must play your quest cards to advance along multiple tracks. These tracks represent fighting, hiding, traveling, and friendship, and by playing quest cards from your hand with matching symbols, you can keep moving forward and push closer to victory.&#10;&#10;The master game board indicates both the physical progress of the fellowship across Middle Earth and the corrupting influence of Sauron on the hobbits. If you're able to slip past your foes, you can hope to escape with minimal corruption, healing your hurts at safe havens along your path, such as the forest kingdom of Lothl&oacute;rien. By playing your cards right and advancing quickly, you can collect powerful runes, unlock legendary cards to aid your journey, or find life tokens to help stave off corruption &mdash; not to mention advancing quickly through the conflicts. As you travel, the One Ring can be a crucial tool in your journey, allowing you to hide from sight, but repeated use will draw the attention of Sauron and corrupt the heart of the Ring-bearer.&#10;&#10;Your journey leads you deeper into the darkness with each passing conflict, and safe havens become few and far between. You must carefully watch the corruption track because if the Sauron miniature ever meets a Hobbit, that player is eliminated &mdash; and if the Ring-bearer is eliminated, all players lose as Sauron reclaims the power of the One Ring.

Players then sum their points, scoring points for the routes that they've claimed during the game, the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their taxis), and the tourist attractions that they've reached with their taxis.

475,1152,16992,Tsuro,2005,6.53897,"From the publisher:&#10;&#10;A beautiful and beautifully simple game of laying a tile before your own token to continue its path on each turn.  The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go.  Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;&#10;Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&quot;, and the game as a whole representing &quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&quot;.&#10;&#10;This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.&#10;&#10;Other notes:&#10;&#10;Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time.

477,1166,21523,Runebound: Second Edition,2005,6.53073,"Runebound is a classic adventure game from Fantasy Flight Games in which mighty heroes must take on the perils of Terrinoth. The game can be largely played without conflict between the players but victory can only be claimed by the first player to defeat the Dragonlord Margath, so the players are actually in a race to level up and acquire powerful weapons, armour and allies in order to take on the final adversary.&#10;&#10;Runebound features a series of 4 Adventure Decks that helps to pace the speed of the game and ensures that the players level up by acquiring experience before they are ready to take on a harder set of challenges (events and monsters).&#10;&#10;Several of the key features of Runebound are that combat is played out in 3 phases, Ranged, Melee and Magic and a player has the ability to specialise in a particular discipline, although this may make them vulnerable against certain creatures. The game also features a novel movement system using a series of terrain dice.&#10;&#10;Runebound is playable solo and is expandable by many adventure packs that alter the final challenge (replacing the Dragonlord for example). Runebound 2nd Edition also has a series of big box expansions that provide a new map or central map overlay to alter the game in some way.&#10;&#10;Runebound 2nd Edition is different from 1st Edition in that the original game featured a d20 and this was replaced by 2 10-sided dice, which helped to better balance the luck factor.&#10;&#10;",2,6,120,240,"['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Open Drafting', 'Role Playing', 'Variable Player Powers']",12,240,2.6759,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1484,8,49,142,0.0,0.0,0.11815481490760388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.374045942731283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11997922309534678,0.0,0.0,0.11532461740199591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11031059642417741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12396707845601779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12770991004191143,0.0,0.0,0.18832623359251385,0.0,0.07247707815966063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29230018936176266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12692609495094412,0.0,0.12770991004191143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35807894152798564,0.25385218990188824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0889476911360076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25385218990188824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1212549455166551,0.0,0.08383057418506965,0.0,0.07766095201581756,0.24122166072786838,0.0806930350011207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12061083036393419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08261825675905965,0.11173535348096604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1697530811790283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11125346685550246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1175687314425124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30971658492763976,0.08050663476441655,0.0,0.0,0.1127210880770118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11997922309534678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10003692577890501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08639981067367926,0.0,0.0,0.09620582615434257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11587129837615347,0.0,0.0,0.0

They taught you to light a flickering flame at the tip of your finger, but other than that you've spent much more time reading books than learning powerful spells as future great wizards like you should.&#10;&#10;So when you heard about the Big Book of Madness hidden in the great school library, you couldn't help but to sneak in and peek in this intriguing tome in spite of your professors' warnings. When you slowly lift the cover of the terrible book, dozens of dreadful creatures rush out, threatening to destroy the world itself! This was your mistake, and only you can fix it now! Learn from the library to fight back against the monsters, and try not to sink into insanity...&#10;&#10;The Big Book of Madness is a challenging co-operative game in which the players are magic students who must act as a team to turn all the pages of the book, then shut it by defeating the terrible monsters they've just freed.&#10;&#10;Each player has their own element deck that they build during the game and use for several purposes, such as learning or casting a spell, adding a new element to their deck, destroy or healing a curse. Spells allow you to support your playmates, improve your deck, draw cards, etc. &mdash; but the monsters from the book fight back. Each comes with terrible curses that are triggered every turn unless you dispel them in time. They will make you discard elements, add madness cards to your deck, or lose spells...&#10;&#10;If you manage to turn six pages and defeat all of the monsters, you win the game!&#10;&#10;",2,5,60,90,"['Cooperative Game', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Player Elimination', 'Variable Player Powers']",12,90,2.6774,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Fantasy']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1623,17,70,168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13055735488414547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12650392576660177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24223789005105822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10380697601368796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14377969044393699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3895126178751513,0.15304392592921542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14530847993011606,0.11387274800509847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14941534172955828,0.0,0.0,0.11318283379385936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2569559493646525,0.0,0.0,0.12070205190353442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11565292655185566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13820174329223112,0.0,0.0,0.10046017714657358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.097606771753715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5781463625625098,0.0,0.0,0.14020111155625808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13332299220330032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1350817477567504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12028957043174433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13002701833125835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18138315832776492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12070205190353442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08809200705120984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.106592384642088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10897353005545002,0.0

Each faction involves a different gaming mechanism - Pirates move their minions around, Zombies bring back their cards from the discard pile, Dinosaurs have enormous power - and each combination of factions brings a different gaming experience.&#10;&#10;During the game, players compete to score points from Base cards. Players play minions to the bases, and you want to have the highest total power of minions at the base when it breaks. Sounds easy? Is it easy when an opponent's Alien-Ninja plays minions to your bases that destroy your minions? What happens when the Pirate-Dinosaur player plays Full Sail and frees King Rex to trample your minions into the ground, or when the Wizard-Zombies player uses their mystic power to create an outbreak, suddenly flooding minions to the base from their discard pile? Or if you were facing a Zombie-Dinosaur player instead who created an epidemic of massive beasts?!?&#10;&#10;With eight different factions, Smash Up includes dozens of combinations to try.

Each player starts with an identical set of 12 dice in their dice bag. At the start of the game, Creature and Spell dice (Quarry) are dealt at random to form &quot;the Wilds&quot; in the center of the table. As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon Creatures, cast Spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture Quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll 6 dice a turn from their bag, making that controlling bag composition is key to victory.&#10;&#10;Quarriors is a fast-paced game where players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do I use my Quiddity to summon Creatures in the hopes of scoring Glory or should I spend it all to capture more powerful Quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponent's through strategic Spell use, the acquisition of powerful Quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opponent's Creature in combat.

483,1192,97903,Terror in Meeple City,2013,6.518,"In Terror in Meeple City (formerly known as Rampage), you arrive in Meeple City as a gigantic, famished, scaly-skinned monster! Your goal: Dig your claws and dirty paws into the asphalt, destroy buildings, and devour innocent meeples &ndash; in short: sow terror while having fun. The monster who has caused the most damage after the carnage finally ends wins the game.&#10;&#10;The buildings in Meeple City are comprised of floor tiles and meeples, with the meeples serving as pillars that support the floors. Four wooden vehicles are on the ground in the eight neighborhoods in the city. Each monster, which consists of a wooden paws disc and a wooden body, starts in one corner of the game board. On a turn you take two actions from four possibilities, repeating an action if desired:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Move: Pick up your monster body, flick the paws disc, then place the body back on the disc.&#10;    Demolish: If your paws are on the sidewalk surrounding a building, you can pick up your monster body, drop it onto a building, then collect any floors that have no meeples on them.&#10;    Toss a vehicle: If you're in a neighborhood with a vehicle, you can pick up the vehicle, place it on your body, then flick the vehicle at a building or another monster.&#10;    Breathe: Even while away from sidewalks with no vehicles, you can cause destruction by placing your chin on your monster's body and blowing across the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;Monsters tend to be messy when obtaining meals, but if you knock meeples off the city board, you might be punished for letting food go to waste, costing you a tooth or letting other players take an additional action. After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have. If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food! Meeples come in six colors, with the colors representing different types of inhabitants: blue (journalists), green (military), yellow (blondes), grey (old people), red (heroes), and black (businessmen).

You score points for collecting floors and teeth, too, and you can also score for achieving the goal on your character card.&#10;&#10;In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that's revealed only upon use.&#10;&#10;Terror in Meeple City includes rules for monsters that evolve over the course of the game, that lose points for meeples not in sets, and that want to combine two game boards to allow for play with up to eight players.&#10;&#10;",2,4,45,45,"['Area Movement', 'Flicking', 'Set Collection', 'Stacking and Balancing', 'Variable Player Powers']",8,45,1.4798,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Action / Dexterity', 'Horror']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2811,18,137,220,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14701675168990644,0.13978285617963218,0.0,0.10048429421701315,0.0944550735432161,0.0,0.08605218878867646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15082131771816068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10223316364394981,0.08238914531752665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10410558191940321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22175840375894815,0.17909207804095817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1889101470864322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5086446870531859,0.0,0.16651712888521936,0.0,0.19768734719919903,0.0,0.09108356580384985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0927157676538701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08917519510569123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05908130696477162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1956074800221828,0.0,0.0,0.05849596514346004,0.07433703415081347,0.0,0.0,0.08046494009654288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1376893021228483,0.0,0.0,0.10223316364394981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0914822937339141,0.16651712888521936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08325856444260968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10105452926305175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09400943435264537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06330705737219804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.092298201422706,0.0,0.0,0.1966372175299336,0.07652959736256904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07942500650803477,0.0,0.0,0.06547569663783655,0.10223316364394981,0.10163729794566631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09314001522756235,0.0,0.0,0.1309513932756731,0.0,0.0,0.0944550735432161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08638157075962444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07519242793429326,0.0,0.21350191655226733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06562677914166512,0.09583877397088487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1636499541239386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09108356580384985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07867097727832481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09490833086562567,0.07519242793429326,0.05992312076962795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08385443014089318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060919102940181394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

486,1214,173090,The Game,2015,6.50488,"Players in The Game try to discard all 98 cards in the deck onto four discard piles in order to win, but they need to do so in the right ways.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 6-8 cards in their hand depending on the number of players, and four discard pile prompt cards are on the table: two showing &quot;1&quot; and an up arrow and two showing &quot;100&quot; and a down arrow. On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from their hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. One tricky aspect of the game is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97.&#10;&#10;After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck.

488,1226,278,Catan Card Game,1996,6.49793,"Catan Card Game bears only a slight resemblance to The Settlers of Catan, the original game in the Catan series.  There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.&#10;&#10;When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),&#10;     a bonus resource,&#10;     an attack if a player has too many resources, and&#10;     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     &#10;&#10;&#10;There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table. Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands. Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns. Some of the cards have flags on them, indicating victory points.&#10;&#10;Whoever first has twelve victory points wins the game!&#10;&#10;The Anniversary edition of this game (Jubil&auml;umsausgabe, tin box edition) can be found under a separate game entry due to some differences in content: Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel &#226;&#128;&#147; 10th Anniversary Special Edition Tin Box.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;",2,2,60,120,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Trading']",10,120,2.4394,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'City Building', 'Territory Building']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2445,22,136,200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0743811083745785,0.07072121819379833,0.0,0.10167729992924104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08878332514001304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20939010264698932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09557649697723655,0.1902511338181611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15043920995014112,0.0,0.1979298413706836,0.08578060018551859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0989649206853418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3805022676363222,0.05978275326783904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2411039537529656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07790481489260886,0.0,0.0,0.1911529939544731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0735680247122769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08578060018551859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09650175099362879,0.0,0.09256842266423794,0.0,0.10111244311882392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09557649697723655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06405867414632058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07935542262401557,0.13250612141920448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09216496081329682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07862031616105884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20689386582328423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3346294760939635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17031325075309392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3311857957210787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1526119527120724,0.0,0.07201224355144785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0842470566616764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12868218945533277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07837968936885897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28506770388916897,0.0,0.10111244311882392,0.0,0.0,0.07910814246352652,0.0,0.08986386207331218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06164236858440713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
489,1244,152162,Diamonds,2014,6.48913,"Diamonds is a trick-taking card game in which players collect Diamonds &mdash; not cards bearing that suit, mind you, but rather actual &quot;Diamond Crystals&quot; (acrylic crystals) included in the game.&#10;&#10;What makes the game of Diamonds different from other trick-taking card games is that when you cannot follow suit you get a &quot;Suit Action&quot; based on what suit you do play. Suit Actions are also taken by the winner of each trick, as well as at the end of a full Round of play.&#10;&#10;Suit Actions will enable players to take Diamond Crystals from the Supply, moving them to their Showroom (where they may score 1 point) or to their Vault (where they will score 2 points). The Vault is a secure area, but the Showroom is vulnerable to theft by the other players.&#10;&#10;The deck in Diamonds consists of sixty cards, numbered 1-15 in the standard suits. In each round, the players start with a hand of ten cards. One player leads a card, and everyone else must play one card, following suit if possible.  As you play a card, if you cannot follow suit, you immediately get a Suit Action in the suit you did play. The player who played the highest card in the suit that was led wins the trick, and also gets a Suit Action.&#10; The player who won the trick leads a card to start the next trick. After a full Round of ten tricks, whoever has taken the most cards in each suit once again gets a Suit Action. If a player has taken no tricks, that player gets two Diamonds Suit Actions.

491,1253,154246,La Isla,2014,6.484,"Ready to start exploring a previously uncharted island? Good! You and the other players each have a team of five scientists, and you want to capture animal species so that you can study them &mdash; and, of course, score points.&#10;&#10;The game board in La Isla consists of a set of oddly-shaped tiles that are placed in a circular arrangement around a central polygonal tile. Thirty-five animal tokens (seven each of five types) are placed at random on spaces numbered 2, 3 and 4 on the game board; these numbers equal the number of camps that surround these spaces.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player has three cards that he places face-down in the A, B and D spaces on his card display. All players reveal their A cards at the same time, then place them in one of the three slots at the top of their display; the image depicted on the top of this card shows the special power that the owner of this card has available. Once a player has filled all three slots on her display, future cards placed with the A action cover an existing card.&#10;&#10;After revealing the cards in their B slots simultaneously, the players collect the goods depicted in the lower-left corner of their individual card.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn then places one of his scientists on a camp, first paying two resources of the type matching that camp. (If all of a player's scientists are on the board, she moves one of these scientists.) If the player now has a scientist on each camp surrounding an animal space, she takes that animal tile, scoring points for it as noted on the board (4, 3 or 2 points).&#10;&#10;Finally, the card in the D slot increases the value of one animal. You (and only you!) immediately score one point per animal of the type you moved up on the scale. If you don't have an animal of that type you don't get any points. Each animal has a points threshold so that if you move an animal up, say, four times, each animal of this type is worth an extra point at the end of the game. The scale goes up to five so that every animal can be worth up five points at the end of the game. When the sum of these values for all five animals equals seven, nine or eleven (based on the number of players), the game ends at the conclusion of the round. Players then tally their final scores to see who wins.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,60,"['Action Queue', 'Commodity Speculation', 'Enclosure', 'Hand Management', 'Modular Board', 'Multi-Use Cards', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']",10,60,2.2482,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Animals'],False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2305,20,97,186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07017180277064017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07706699386082404,0.0,0.07976223833177967,0.0,0.0,0.07892311001691671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0794794266078803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08850736377659403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08512749915994153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11168162217549352,0.07096284796154097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07349609900940601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09877024762170934,0.07394409983671854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09877024762170934,0.0,0.4164283942372536,0.06571976622481004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06368121599160322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09240913112987928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09288225492298749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06338166946645875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07305588989708844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12500745984189707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09817465811990149,0.0,0.06250372992094853,0.24277855584453542,0.18576450984597498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16009649147200322,0.0,0.08246067848305787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09759276155105467,0.0,0.07892311001691671,0.10000519429811093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06293889340662503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13587398902731498,0.0948684802684241,0.08732987770593935,0.0,0.0,0.08657425783357305,0.0,0.06264795473259606,0.0,0.18297723130354318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08477837105976317,0.29452397435970445,0.0719877404368841,0.0,0.06793699451365749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07157279039027788,0.0,0.0844339931493259,0.0,0.18209989234927693,0.0,0.16620301458527828,0.07510007176586443,0.05889123869868787,0.09240913112987928,0.0,0.09759276155105467,0.17782470918384868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37152901969194996,0.09060040571214151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08584054309971036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08004824573600161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05815396174035077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877117796070216

Otherwise, their profit will suddenly vanish, the worst fear of a good businessperson.&#10;&#10;Power Grid: Factory Manager uses a clever market mechanism for choosing the supply of factory tiles in the market.&#10;&#10;",2,5,60,60,"['Auction / Bidding', 'Commodity Speculation']",12,60,2.9958,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,763,7,35,76,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21331736994259023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2694465572189306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24691975239052014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2566306997710008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24252503353907917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6870081353634613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2649099763486057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2085614671891932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15885977801005577,0.0,0.2161868543398906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19651624901130207,0.0

496,1300,22141,Cleopatra and the Society of Architects,2006,6.46609,"Designed by Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, Cleopatra and the Society of Architects is a fun and engaging family game that includes a true, three-dimensional palace that players compete to build. Players strive to become the wealthiest of Cleopatra&rsquo;s architects by constructing the most magnificent and valuable parts of her palace.&#10;&#10;Players, however, will be tempted to deal with shady characters and trade in materials of dubious origins in order to help them build faster. While these corrupt practices might allow an architect to stay a step ahead of the rest, they come with a high price &ndash; cursed Corruption Amulets honoring Sobek, the Crocodile-god. When Cleopatra finally strolls into her new palace, at the end of the game, the most corrupt architect (the one with the most amulets) will be seized and offered as a sacrifice to her sacred crocodile! Only then will the wealthiest architect, from among those still alive, be selected and declared the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The component design in Cleopatra is the most innovative we&rsquo;ve undertaken to date,&rdquo; said Days of Wonder CEO, Eric Hautemont. &ldquo;While it&rsquo;s still a board game, the dozens of 3D pieces &ndash; Column walls, Doorframes, Obelisks, Sphinxes, and Palace Throne &ndash; all create the sense that you&rsquo;re constructing a royal palace.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The game play really forces players into continually weighing the risks and rewards between taking enough corruption to enhance your position in the game, but not so much that you are forced out of the game at the end,&rdquo; said the game&rsquo;s co-designer, Bruno Cathala. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a classic &lsquo;push your luck&rsquo; dilemma that continually raises the tension level higher and higher until the game reaches its climax.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher.&#10;&#10;",3,5,60,60,"['Auction / Bidding', 'Dice Rolling', 'Enclosure', 'Grid Coverage', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection']",10,60,2.282,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Ancient'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1887,11,104,173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10263542383953443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10111105011640853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16844177627059978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10959479992406233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10863640440397958,0.0,0.11604924042538257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11108915501007541,0.0,0.0,0.09759358035667427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13953760525825656,0.0,0.1014853104823299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12052888587515817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12193465650038181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09792823566817219,0.1154581086008709,0.0,0.10592406024319963,0.0,0.09930343632308515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12340583486727483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1178919731915808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11008511411499045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11374825263446003,0.0,0.28419332457988405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08032686229392885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11430799524366636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09565677325687898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7211979702256921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24833582212763752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10959479992406233,0.0,0.0,0.07583994095965692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12340583486727483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10074116716510054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
497,1302,1115,Poker,1810,6.46531,"Poker is played with a standard deck of 52-cards, and sometimes Jokers are added as wild cards. The object of the game is to win the pot which contains all the bets the players have made in a deal.  Players are dealt cards which are usually reduced to a Poker hand of five (5) cards. Betting and bluffing are used in rounds until all bets are squared up, or until all other players have conceded the pot (folded).

But other than the fact that they both use fantasy creatures as a general theme, there is very little that is similar between the two.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by: Galaxy: The Dark Ages&#10;&#10;",2,5,40,60,"['Betting and Bluffing', 'Hand Management', 'Investment']",8,60,2.0203,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Mythology']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1366,8,66,135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1690924810708044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14818188340310842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3748018673455455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20088808351784535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18472846214044814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11494452399147491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.158113541929203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20088808351784535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19528033518555848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19422773833393062,0.0,0.0,0.2058539127808926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1286596907083901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14286493641397793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.509219149128495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20088808351784535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12955544524248802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19857206791676826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14818188340310842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19971720790473133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2354977672752741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16597168175140237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

You'll also need to manage your employees, invest in advertising in order to attract and please the different kinds of guests visiting your park, and, above all, keep the dirt that your park produces under strict control!&#10;&#10;Steam Park is an easy-to-learn game with two difficulty levels: one for the less experienced gamers and a more strategic one for those who want a more exciting challenge. In this management game, you'll have to build your own amusement park and make it the largest and most profitable in the region. By constructing the three-dimensional, wonderful rides designed by Marie Cardouat, you will see your park grow right before your eyes. Choose your strategy! Build Stands to attract more Visitors, or Toilets to keep the Dirt under control. Whatever decision you take, take it quickly: The less time you spend planning, the more time you'll have to maintain your park.

The cleric heals, magician burns everything in sight, and the goblin is so weak that the simple fact of getting him out will bring you two victory points.&#10;&#10;Combat and actions are managed via cards. To move, fight, heal, or turn a room, you must manage action points obtained by playing cards. Those cards are not drawn but selected from a set of cards by both players. Both players have access to the same panel of cards at the beginning of the game, so the game is really about managing the resources and adapting to the changing environment.&#10;&#10;Dungeon Twister is the original game in the Dungeon Twister series&#10;&#10;",2,2,60,60,"['Action Points', 'Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Map Deformation', 'Modular Board', 'Secret Unit Deployment', 'Variable Player Powers']",11,60,2.8841,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Maze']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1386,13,59,129,0.0,0.15382596870721066,0.0,0.1156141587342297,0.21985082838400835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12697458679404441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14999734477365848,0.0,0.1627325882460195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14452027709328982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15893881823309872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09292322845029666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1522520946178713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13094927992634786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1522520946178713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1617513026514692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1627325882460195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36109783064742557,0.15716396682172626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14325646178249682,0.13691697342575312,0.0,0.14325646178249682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1143503434234367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4522063955052507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15630408659271017,0.1300326998740386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15716396682172626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13236306662674446,0.10321796358151511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15463575558052425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13911235996654972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13911235996654972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09424723532353528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12739796823365004,0.0,0.0,0.22154726843724273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12296161673054713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
508,1373,16986,Ubongo,2003,6.43533,"In Ubongo, players compete to solve individual puzzles as quickly as they can to get first crack at the gems on hand for the taking.&#10;&#10;Original edition:&#10;The game board consists of six rows, with twelve gems (of various colors) placed in these rows. At the start of play, each player places their pawn in front of one of those rows. Each player also takes twelve polyominoes &mdash; that is, pieces consisting of 2-5 squares in some configuration; players use these pieces each round to try to recreate shapes.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, each player receives a puzzle card that depicts a shape created by some number of squares; one side of this card depicts six rows of 3 pieces, the other side depicts six rows of 4 pieces, for a more difficult puzzle. When everyone is ready, someone rolls a die to determine which row of pieces each player can use to recreate the shape on their individual card. The race is timed by a sand timer, and the outcome of this race determines the action on the main playing board.&#10;&#10;Whoever first solves their puzzle in time gets to move their pawn up to three rows left or right, with the second player to finish moving two rows and the third player only one row. Players then collect two gems from the front of the row where their pawn is located, which means that the more rows you can move, the more control you have over which color gems you can collect. After collecting gems, each player receives a new puzzle card, and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;After nine rounds, the game ends and whoever has collected the most gems in a single color wins! If players tie, then those players compare who has the most gems in a second color, and so on.&#10;&#10;2015 edition:&#10;The puzzle-part of the game remains the same, but the scoring track and system has been greatly changed, to be the same as in Ubongo Extreme. There are no pawns anymore, but instead the winner takes a 3-point gem plus a random gem, the second-place player takes a 1-point gem plus a random gem, and others who finish within time take just a random gem. Whoever scores the most gem-points after nine rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",1,4,25,25,"['Grid Coverage', 'Pattern Building', 'Real-Time', 'Set Collection']",8,25,1.5068,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Puzzle', 'Real-time']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2161,15,93,176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06479897771159944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09177097446251965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1467878945658091,0.23983665157181133,0.08713250604288515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08577056494087927,0.0,0.08173064487765361,0.0,0.07734583192733974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09012040350780544,0.0,0.08287103573266298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14002919170227143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06552945516365509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07828716891716796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18024080701561088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058805353899415026,0.08490478536826916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05866663909431223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08326387482950436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08577056494087927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058528742670402326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13492447946978434,0.08808665387219926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05771802407980841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08029182909530823,0.0824846901421995,0.07796915889516907,0.0,0.0,0.4224181603158598,0.05771802407980841,0.07472993238440084,0.08577056494087927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06409063938130972,0.0,0.14783842758761384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16896726412634394,0.2703612105234163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07614693446842291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17435960556887753,0.14328650167964296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08760471151838475,0.08064331505804699,0.2378040417709071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1592086545901749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08621578556513422,0.2163906413634104,0.0,0.09120773332741204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12547056280348104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08621578556513422,0.0,0.1982780888962881,0.08100016742559796,0.0,0.0,0.05605236671389664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10876425895221288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08533366668668088,0.0,0.0,0.0723775534086612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10564665380039658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07140352180438625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23486150675150388,0.0,0.07445655644863945,0.0,0.10740260679837793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

With all players playing at the same time, someone reveals a card, then players grab for the &quot;right&quot; object &ndash; but which object is right?&#10;&#10;&#10;    If one object is colored correctly &ndash; say, a green bottle and a red mouse &ndash; then players need to grab that correctly colored object.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    If both objects are colored incorrectly &ndash; say, a green ghost and a red mouse &ndash; then you look for the object and color not represented among the four details shown. In this case you see green, red, ghost and mouse, so players need to grab the blue book.&#10;&#10;&#10;The first player to grab the correct object keeps the card, then reveals the next card from the deck. If a player grabs the wrong object, she must discard one card previously collected. Once the card deck runs out, the game ends and whoever has collected the most cards wins!&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;    Knapp daneben, released in 2004 by HABA.&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,8,20,20,"['Pattern Recognition', 'Speed Matching']",8,20,1.1416,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Action / Dexterity', 'Card Game', ""Children's Game"", 'Real-time']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2008,20,125,175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21241135729860244,0.1157533705885002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1044308556173767,0.0,0.23271559113833218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1157533705885002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08705425394614198,0.0,0.0,0.09423049236420059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11336365717287308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08514282290821874,0.08062226055690934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11336365717287308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09615178241147158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11394406565444258,0.0,0.0,0.24087312909643788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2400810493694445,0.0,0.07413732215737046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5580759118420204,0.18846098472840117,0.18368155789714696,0.0,0.11972271817465972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08514282290821874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4046372461897682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10620567864930122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12116720883924481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09750203643413523,0.08780250580763108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07224530858255468,0.11336365717287308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09184077894857348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10400255986592753,0.0,0.0,0.11009211310293844,0.07134084804576081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
511,1383,25821,The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow,2001,6.43153,"Werewolves of Miller's Hollow is a game that takes place in a small village which is haunted by werewolves. Each player is secretly assigned a role - Werewolf, Ordinary Townsfolk, or special character such as The Sheriff, The Hunter, the Witch, the Little Girl, The Fortune Teller and so on... There is also a Moderator player who controls the flow of the game. The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers (normal and special villagers alike) then deliberate and vote on a player they suspect is a Werewolf, helped (or hindered) by the clues the special characters add to the general deliberation. The chosen player is &quot;lynched&quot;, reveals their role, and is out of the game. Werewolf is a social game that requires no equipment to play, and can accommodate almost any large group of players.&#10;&#10;The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow/les Loups-Garous de Thiercelieux/Die Werw&ouml;lfe von D&uuml;sterwald is a published version arranged by Herv&#195;&#169; Marly and Philippe des Palli&#195;&#168;res and published by Lui-m&#195;&#170;me, 2001 for 8-23 players.

512,1389,10,Elfenland,1998,6.42929,"Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;  &#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.

513,1393,85256,Timeline: Inventions,2010,6.42691,"Timeline: Inventions is a card game played using 55 cards. Each card depicts an invention on both sides, with the year in which that invention was created on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all their cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.&#10;&#10;Timeline: Inventions can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.&#10;&#10;",2,8,15,15,['Ordering'],8,15,1.0935,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Educational', 'Trivia']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,997,9,36,95,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2716698315872495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17013903810334463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1193158502416437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18524746488572977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1599697785225005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12016119077163054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16478426065969282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11987774487676667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18524746488572977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12131210171762807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11793937188573599,0.15270102237548758,0.0,0.510417114310034,0.0,0.12462804142023297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35628146823951967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15159026317048727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16266122256000012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1761708887006824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29994221669098114,0.13505193935489718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13952640427104915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14688871675180407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21946343774998853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The player who has the most power points at the end of the game becomes the ruler of entire Laar and the winner!&#10;&#10;",1,4,45,60,"['Auction: Sealed Bid', 'Hand Management', 'Memory', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection', 'Tile Placement']",13,60,2.6368,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'City Building', 'Civilization', 'Fantasy', 'Negotiation']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,807,7,26,91,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20923302744104336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22966436150911848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21334079324746472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14223098857030406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1622011236479384,0.0,0.23188768920608444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25472118635301866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2515756789150948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1599387822651629,0.0,0.2244199988737209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19564781856515998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16823075925422845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4200678174388809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2010234403850219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15956932501433593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19827961719876244,0.0,0.25005866506851737,0.19695028940565104,0.0,0.0,0.1712499784757999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20537138743493916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18023837178386584,0.0

Core Sets are completely self-contained, with multiple decks included, providing a great game experience right out of the box.&#10;&#10;&#10;        The Core Sets are followed by monthly installments of expansion packs, each a set of forty fixed cards, providing an ongoing and regular addition to the available card pool.

517,1409,9220,Saboteur,2004,6.42115,"Players take on the role of dwarves. As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.&#10;&#10;With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.&#10;&#10;Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.&#10;&#10;The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.&#10;&#10;The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.&#10;&#10;Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.&#10;&#10;Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over.

Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.&#10;&#10;To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols (dagger, pirate hat, etc.), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.&#10;&#10;When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew. With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don't want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!&#10;&#10;",2,5,45,45,"['Action Points', 'Catch the Leader', 'Hand Management', 'Modular Board', 'Race', 'Resource to Move', 'Track Movement']",8,45,1.5995,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Nautical', 'Pirates']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1247,9,53,121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20364138618187955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14982549636399675,0.0,0.0,0.10986133437720949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15261909907945034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0852193162554425,0.0,0.0,0.14806937565246314,0.0,0.0,0.11216325807270104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09718465006878105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15073443248301602,0.09695540308871299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12938126567700503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6689486987228485,0.1455763814795217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11722461815520911,0.114251766845417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15073443248301602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.357617927017889,0.0,0.0,0.12938126567700503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10922807424786825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1410266580525345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10260637446988753,0.24432513196666605,0.0,0.114251766845417,0.0,0.0,0.15073443248301602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
520,1439,7805,Fearsome Floors,2003,6.40767,"The storyline in Friedemann Friese's Fearsome Floors (aka, Finstere Flure) continues the FFF-saga from Friese's earlier game, with players trying to escape from F&uuml;rst Fieso. Story aside, what we have is a wonderful race game in which the players must move through a dungeon as quickly as possible &ndash; or at least within 14 turns &ndash; before it crumbles over their heads.&#10;&#10;Players could reach the exit in only seven turns if everything were peaceful and quiet, but unfortunately the dungeon is also the home of a very hungry monster! Each round, players take turns moving one disk at a time, flipping over the disk after moving it to reveal the movement points available for the next round.

521,1458,394,Kahuna,1998,6.39689,"&quot;Who will rule the South Seas? Two Kahuna - ancient sorcerers of the Pacific - compete for dominance on an archipelago consisting of twelve small islands. Using their magic and wisdom, they struggle for control of the islands. They anxiously await the cards handed to them by fate. But when the time is right, they move to capture one, two, or even more islands, trying to gain the upper hand. At the mercy of the magical powers of the South Seas, they quickly realize that even the best magic is no good without strategy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Originally published in 1997 as Arabana-Ikibiti by the designer's own publisher Bambus Spieleverlag, then reprinted by Funagain in the U.S., Kosmos' Kahuna &ndash; part of its Kosmos two-player series &ndash; is the best known implementation of this design.&#10;&#10;It's a two-player game, played on a board depicting twelve islands. Players use cards to place bridges between these islands or remove opponent's bridges. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island &ndash; which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there.&#10;&#10;The game is played in three rounds. A round ends when all cards from the face down deck and the three face up cards have been taken. Then points are scored for the islands with a marker stone on them. The game can also end sooner when one player has absolutely NO bridges left on the board.&#10;&#10;The Kosmos edition has excellent graphics and nice wooden pieces and plays very well.&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;     Arabana-Ikibiti&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;     Kanaloa&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,2,30,40,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Hand Management', 'Network and Route Building', 'Open Drafting', 'Take That']",10,40,2.0494,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Abstract Strategy'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1748,17,110,162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11687028832694225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23296902999775013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1408537607280953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12701853265299598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09589168745099944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11497906231919786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846812800823771,0.10761349426375018,0.0,0.0,0.23296902999775013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22426898559453154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12272266158622822,0.0,0.0,0.09657107019626748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14013627959454092,0.0,0.0,0.09634327057782191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1462908916047519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1408537607280953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27218421719441427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13361485406057377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11078754325973887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3449371869575936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2637129903856205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12804216993045267,0.0,0.0,0.13874033946574674,0.18957088038395367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.200321971830162,0.0,0.13673723509473315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13874033946574674,0.11610258027504602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12504968452972443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09544535540979646,0.11765366496689043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12182996732722158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13739338992821987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12804216993045267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18410014332550378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08930718199643084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12804216993045267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08674729207148225,0.0,0.11805143145957551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1131766597024283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13673723509473315,0.0,0.0,0.0

523,1467,116,Guillotine,1998,6.3925,"The French Revolution is famous in part for the use of the guillotine to put nobles to death, and this is the macabre subject of this light card game.  As executioners pandering to the masses, the players are trying to behead the most popular nobles.  Each day the nobles are lined up and players take turns killing the ones at the front of the line until all the nobles are gone.  However, players are given cards which will manipulate the line order right before 'harvesting' heads, which is what makes the game interesting.

526,1490,150312,Welcome to the Dungeon,2013,6.38434,"Welcome to the Dungeon &mdash; first released as Dungeon of Mandom &mdash; is a push-your-luck dungeon delve in which 2-4 players take turns essentially daring each other to go into a dungeon with less equipment than they start off with while filling the dungeon with monsters. Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.&#10;&#10;Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.&#10;&#10;If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.&#10;&#10;The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Dungeon includes four different sets of character cards whereas Dungeon of Mandom has only a single character.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,30,"['Betting and Bluffing', 'Memory', 'Player Elimination', 'Push Your Luck']",10,30,1.2285,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2173,20,85,161,0.0,0.09779844359399158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08604752875947791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08238468365503755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09400434341056488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10346103448095219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28334987540461015,0.0,0.22299902561553878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26494512313103497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05907810750384657,0.0,0.15491169146746558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07433300853851293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07698656849531177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23236753720119838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06884092288101845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06670555802117975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18295467929080328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08325405569801185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08604752875947791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25620247996421536,0.09679781647203095,0.095364306725198,0.09729340981366158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09400434341056488,0.09883832086643202,0.0,0.06833266185075362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13278357092400933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29493985339772993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06547215089818224,0.0,0.0,0.0944499584682034,0.0,0.06918525852347072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26371192450081715,0.24380448592636664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.191667167927238,0.0,0.0,0.27089630727512354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09779844359399158,0.0,0.0,0.10346103448095219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2134903546712846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07745584573373279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21751130395637644,0.0,0.09400434341056488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It was first work-shopped by game designers at Protospiel 2004 and refined at Protospiel 2005, PowWow 2005, the GoF 2005 - 2007, and weekly game nights at the Looney Labs.&#10;&#10;",3,8,30,30,"['Betting and Bluffing', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Player Judge']",13,30,1.0906,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Humor', 'Party Game']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1953,21,206,187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18204667488061538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14577775465494983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13467587141942708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16501544266261226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1810353350418149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10703717993290715,0.0,0.1403337995570906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37263886705245347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32179094633239713,0.18744976492453402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1403337995570906,0.0,0.17537740690415138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18521508907364936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12085652567616711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15833289933218506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1547284440089263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1425276450884663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12380449765316859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1687410973289873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1317188230384288,0.0,0.0,0.28152925274655854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15083894383908886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11176593271754942,0.0,0.0,0.3704301781472987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14773871541763145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17112357904420777,0.16155806116089141,0.0,0.0

Perhaps you even saw a fireball engulf a fellow traveler in a hellscape of horror that makes you afraid to close your eyes at night. Whatever the case, welcome back! Turns out that Vul-Kar didn't like having his gem stolen way back when, so there has been some volcanic upheaval, an explosion in our snake population, feral tigers, new types of trees bent on ending human life, and swarms of bees everywhere. But don't worry &mdash; we have top people working on it.&#10;&#10;Start your day of adventure at the helipad. Be sure to sign the waiver, which legally obligates you to take snapshots across the island. You'll race down the many paths, avoiding hazards all the while. On the plus side, you get to keep all the treasure you find.&#10;&#10;Fireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar is a restoration of the classic 1986 game Fireball Island that features a unique 3D island and a host of marble mayhem. This new version boasts an island that is even bigger than the original (and yet fits in a smaller box) and more marbles. It is a family-weight game for 2-4 players (5 with an expansion) that plays in 30-45 minutes. Simple card play replaces the random roll-and-move of the original, and the set collection for the treasures offers some interesting choices for players.&#10;&#10;Remember, you don't have to outrun the fireball &mdash; just the other players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;Bienvenue sur l'&Icirc;le Infernale !

534,1540,2397,Backgammon,1630,6.36613,"Backgammon is a classic abstract strategy game dating back thousands of years. Each player has a set of 15 checkers (or stones) that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of their checkers to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's checkers, forcing the captured checkers to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 checkers off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &quot;doubling cube&quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll and measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.&#10;&#10;Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.&#10;&#10;The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means &quot;Battle on Wood&quot;. In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (&quot;game of twelve marks&quot;), later, Tabula (&quot;table&quot;), and by the sixth century, Alea (&quot;dice&quot;). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from &quot;Bac gamen&quot; meaning &quot;Back Game&quot;, referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board.

Five trophy cards of value 3 to 7 are placed at the top of the cards. When a player has collected enough cubes of a given color, he earns the trophy card for that color.

It's simply killing!&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player will assume the role of &quot;The Don&quot;, and will call out the steps in gameplay.&#10;&#10;Before the skirmish itself, an available pot of cash will be laid out before the players. This pot must be evenly split up amongst all of the surviving hoods.&#10;&#10;After that, the &quot;Don&quot; of the round will ask the players, including himself, to load their guns (in the form of selecting one of three possible cards: &quot;Bang!&quot;, &quot;Bang! Bang! Bang!&quot; or &quot;Click! Click!&quot; from a set of 8 cards: 2 &quot;Bang!&quot;s, 1 Triple-&quot;Bang!&quot; and 5 &quot;Clicks!&quot;), and then count down to all of the players aiming their guns (real foam guns).&#10;&#10;Each player will then take a look at how many guns are pointed at them, and also take a look at the available pot of cash for the round before deciding if they want to &quot;Chicken Out&quot; and remove themselves from the skirmish. If they choose to back down, they will get a &quot;Chicken&quot; token which will deduct from their ill-gotten gains at the end of the game.&#10;But all players have to &quot;Chicken Out&quot; at the same time, using a countdown like the aiming.&#10;&#10;The remaining players will resolve the shootout showing their cards. First, all Triple-&quot;Bangs!&quot; wound the players they are aimed at. If there are still-aiming players with &quot;Bang!&quot; cards, those now wound their targets. &quot;Click!&quot;s are only bluffs and do nothing. A player that is wounded during the standoff does not participate in the split of the cash and receives a bandage (any player that receives a certain number of bandages is eliminated from the game). Now all the used cards are discarded--even those of the players that &quot;Chickened Out&quot;.&#10;&#10;Now the remaining players will finally split the cash.

Basically, each turn the players play a character card and possibly some additional cards to at least match the total power of their opponent, who must then in turn match his opponent&rsquo;s power, and so on. &ndash; If a player is unable to do this, he must retreat from the fight.&#10;&#10;A fight ends when one of the players retreats. The other player is the winner of the fight and attracts a number of dragons. Both players remove all their cards from their combat and support areas and place them onto their face up discard pile. The retreating player then starts the next fight.&#10;&#10;Usually, the game ends when one player runs out of cards and retreats from the last fight. Then the player with dragons on his side is the victor and scores some victory points (crystals). A player wins the game instantly if he has all three dragons on his side and then attracts further dragons.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Description from the publisher.The world of Blue Moon is in chaos. Its god has abandoned it, and its people are in open war against each other, while the ruling power of three elemental dragons reigns above all! In this original 2-player game designed by Reiner Knizia, each player takes control over one of the Blue Moon peoples - the creative machinations of the Mimix, the fiery Vulca, the lofty Flit, and the clever Hoax - in their quest for dominance. The Blue Moon Legends basic set provides all the material needed to play, including details on the various peoples, a game board, full-color rules, and three plastic dragon figures. Expansion packs contain additional people cards.&#10;&#10;Blue Moon is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;",2,2,30,30,"['Auction / Bidding', 'Deck Construction', 'Hand Management', 'Variable Player Powers']",12,30,2.1689,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2993,27,225,226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1935335332973625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10665346152963306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09631022088627987,0.0,0.07572857269231491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09676676664868125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09291031011937628,0.0,0.20705547484468356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09498489299371007,0.10294354644598654,0.08988899549398448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06786102217651578,0.0,0.08382756123488251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12105452528695368,0.10126277328591227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08034368182791315,0.0,0.0,0.15231271687561887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1935335332973625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07935579719937748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10535970114024523,0.0,0.0,0.1018115562623407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09967996637142608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08749566435527464,0.0,0.09770354339115077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0813688538108707,0.0,0.08034368182791315,0.06707814858472919,0.0,0.10412476878344619,0.18662548928381975,0.0,0.0,0.09331274464190988,0.0,0.09061340731562118,0.28625857080265205,0.0,0.0,0.06707814858472919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3539826919564543,0.0,0.0,0.08216394960013278,0.0,0.0,0.10473521769653048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08849567298911358,0.23109806137633732,0.0,0.0,0.1018115562623407,0.09372123103779613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08621713033031633,0.1344658573623471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1850275015272149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19446223397810136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09331274464190988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07681094031499806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26056948711630035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10294354644598654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07935579719937748,0.0,0.0,0.07703268712544577,0.061389678996145294,0.08059637047270203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08298302170644005,0.0,0.0,0.0721544544258839,0.0,0.10237165514538185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08653116658434458,0.0,0.06241003683049812,0.0,0.0,0.22782487037530808,0.0

Each game consists of three rounds in which players draft cards from their hands to build their kingdom. Each card is one of five suits and also has a scoring objective. After all cards have been drafted for the round, players total their points based on the suits of cards they collected and the scoring objectives on each card, then they record their score. Each round, the players each select one card to leave in their kingdom as a &quot;relic of the past&quot; to help them in later rounds.

Character cards are placed face up on table, and also track strength (hand limit) in addition to special ability.&#10;&#10;There are 22 different types of cards in the draw deck. Most common are the BANG! cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within &quot;range&quot; of your current gun.  The target player can play a &quot;MISSED!&quot; card to dodge the shot.  Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5. The Gatling is a deadly exception where range doesn't matter: it can only be used once, but targets all other players at the table!&#10;&#10;Information on the cards is displayed using language-independent symbols, and 7 summary/reference cards are included.&#10;&#10;",4,7,20,40,"['Hand Management', 'Hidden Roles', 'Hot Potato', 'Kill Steal', 'Player Elimination', 'Take That', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers']",8,40,1.6312,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['American West', 'Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Deduction', 'Fighting']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1960,20,125,178,0.13058790336547813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14406587167676468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10811741662622067,0.0,0.0,0.11979383017748454,0.0,0.11812257954699827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1347827659176648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27084337130155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09496911317180642,0.0,0.0,0.2931465051211015,0.0,0.0,0.2541173241253026,0.0,0.22211129285566977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14834170301197394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11105564642783489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12337434107623167,0.0,0.09870363067910681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11936907906300252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09541635161569757,0.117715999957364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1457189507824032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12244710415037104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14657325256055076,0.0,0.0,0.12480903320062692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12154194640576568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2322636390379819,0.14834170301197394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2721430552323698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12946973954155708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32435224987866196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23873815812600505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0884479572685396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13878802793089395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1360715276161849,0.10780453560684088,0.0,0.11279178508023864,0.11691565820141718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10097762056099852,0.12022338084115008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
548,1625,131366,Eight-Minute Empire,2012,6.32892,"Eight-Minute Empire, by Ryan Laukat, is a quick game that implements the Civilization/Exploration theme using card-driven area control (by placing armies and cities in a small map) and set collection (by getting resources from the board and the cards). Players spread through the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majorities in regions and continents. All actions (such as land or sea movement, army production, or the founding of cities) are driven by cards that are face-up (six at a time) and available by increasing prices. Cards also contain resources, which also give points when the game ends if properly collected.&#10;&#10;Its first version was available as print-and-play, and a regular (Kickstarter funded) version was published in 2013. An expansion featuring a European map is available as an expansion (Eight-Minute Empire: Europe Expansion Board), and a stand-alone sequel has also been published (Eight-Minute Empire: Legends).&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;Build an empire and conquer the land in around eight minutes!&#10;&#10;In Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from six displayed.  The card gives a good, and also has an action that the player takes immediately.  Actions help players take over the map, but sets of goods are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects.&#10;&#10;Eight-Minute Empire is the super-quick area control game with tough decisions.

549,1667,242,Junta,1979,6.31512,"Players represent various families in Republica de los Bananas. Each game turn has between 7 and 9 rounds, drawing cards, President assigns roles, foreign aid money is drawn, the president proposes a budget which is voted on, locations are chosen, there are assassination attempts, then the bank may be open or not, there may be a coup and aftermath, then the next round starts. The game is won by whoever has the most pesos in their Swiss bank account when the money runs out.&#10;&#10;The game is for 4 to 7 players (although there are 2 and 3 player variants).  A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.&#10;&#10;Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round. Players assassinated or killed simply become another member of their family and begin again with new cards, but keeping any of their family's funds deposited in their Swiss bank account.&#10;&#10;If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over. At the conclusion of each coup players who have control of the 5 power centres vote to be pro-President or pro-Junta determining if the President stays, or the Junta wins and elects a new President.

Each card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. In other words, there are twelve 12s, eleven 11s, four 4s and a single card ranked 1. The lower the number, the better the rank.&#10;&#10;The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jesters are wild, and may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. For example, the person who first got rid of all his cards becomes The Great Dalmuti. Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round.  The Great Dalmuti is generally played for many rounds.&#10;&#10;It is a commercial version of the traditional playing card game President (based on the Chinese game Zheng Shang Yu), which has also been reimagined as:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Dilbert: Corporate Shuffle&#10;    Pyramid Card &#10;    Scum: The Food Chain Game &#10;    Deathtrap Dungeon: Card Game&#10;&#10;&#10;",4,8,60,60,"['Hand Management', 'Ladder Climbing']",8,60,1.2887,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Medieval']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1561,14,82,149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12286701327550137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10559964267109692,0.11305045781474304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11577321590730028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14578194140034142,0.0,0.2739145938604805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14669876730459622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1407109515274611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2782725872114916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10981976344827979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.248724731067171,0.1448872098511406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13555601506089124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09640507936004267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11871155000281215,0.0,0.0,0.09341470662591772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24476330520998482,0.0,0.09319435249208301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11959562897337941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17730126584771955,0.0,0.09211178127123056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10981976344827979,0.2750623163835729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38754915299599124,0.20362119699213624,0.0,0.11742369040713575,0.10880245152173756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1846515702123221,0.11380823029100981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09189900382604017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13695729693024025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23317856619918412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12335880275090433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1243623655335855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
553,1698,811,Rummikub,1977,6.30358,"Rummikub is similar to several central European card games which are played with two decks of playing cards, including Machiavelli and Vatikan. Ephraim Hertzano invented the tile game Rummikub in the 1940s when card-playing was outlawed under the Communist regime. After World War II, Hertzano immigrated to British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel) and developed the first sets with his family. Over the years, the Hertzano family licensed it to other countries and Rummikub became Israel's best-selling export game.&#10;&#10;Hertzano's Official Rummikub Book, published in 1978, describes three different versions of the game: American, Sabra, and International. Modern Rummikub sets include only the Sabra version rules, with no mention of the others, and there are variations in the rules between publishers.&#10;&#10;In Turkey, the game is known as Okey and is widely played by families at gatherings or at local cafes.&#10;&#10;Like Rummy that you play with cards, you try to get rid of all your tiles by forming numbers into runs of 3 tiles or more, or 3 to 4 of a kind. The colors of the numbers on the tiles are like card suits. This game may start rather uneventfully, but when the players start putting more and more tiles in play, the options for your upcoming turns can become more complex, challenging, and exciting (from areyougame.com).&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,60,"['Set Collection', 'Tile Placement']",8,60,1.7186,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Abstract Strategy', 'Card Game', 'Number']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1362,11,60,141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12910497937123352,0.0,0.0,0.12254241157759843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1505319225684023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0899766510225804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30779779869034907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11042408948907191,0.10159334767024136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14817900490517144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15389889934517453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23962066622520412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10017634864162824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14250225952933113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21073992127009208,0.22144863272860035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2290254970770545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2919113460083763,0.0,0.13993756732919505,0.0,0.15389889934517453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2167655436795476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09683722997475938,0.0,0.1325753629361505,0.47924133245040823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12504096071838666,0.0,0.1179661620133843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341591082252594,0.1595425325185007,0.0,0.0,0.15218032812545615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11289083057094618,0.0
554,1713,2987,Pirate's Cove,2002,6.2966,"Come aboard and sail to Pirate's Cove, the legendary hideaway of thieving pirates and cutthroat buccaneers. The tales of those legendary pirates of old who've fought and survived these mysterious waters still haunt all those who yearn for a life at sea. Armed with a secret map and starting with a modestly outfitted sloop salvaged from last winter's storm, you set sail to Pirate's Cove, your eyes filled with visions of treasure and fame, your lungs filled with the salty air of the high seas.&#10;&#10;Your objective: to battle for the rights to plunder and become the most famed and feared pirate the world has ever seen. To do so, you will need to navigate shrewdly, fight recklessly and pillage mercilessly. You will gain fame by winning battles; burying gold and treasure; and bragging about your exploits at the tavern. At the end of twelve months, the pirate with the most fame will be declared the most fearsome pirate of the high seas!&#10;&#10;The game has 12 turns and at the start of every turn, each pirate must decide (secretly) which of the six islands they will visit. All players reveal their navigation directions simultaneously and then the turn is resolved. If any two or more pirates end up at the same island, Combat ensues.&#10;&#10;Combat resolution is determined by the strengths of your ship and the results of cannon fire (dice). The goal of combat is to scare away rival pirates so that you are the only pirate left at the island. If you stay in combat too long, your ship will suffer and make subsequent turns more difficult, so there is a fine balance of when to stay and fight and when to let the bigger ship have its booty. If you flee from combat, you end up at Pirate's Cove where you receive a small compensation for the turn. Once all conflicts are resolved, then the bounty for each island is given out.&#10;&#10;Each island (except Pirate's Cove and Treasure Island) offer various amounts of Fame, Gold, Treasure or Tavern cards. The bounty is skewed so that some Islands are clearly better choices than others, so it can force you to decide (or bluff) if you think you can take the island should other pirates go after the same bounty. Once you have your bounty, you can purchase upgrades for your ship. Each Island offers a different ship component. The four parts of your ship are: Sails (determines speed and initiative in combat), Hull (how much treasure you can carry), Crew (needed to man the cannons), and Cannons. (The lower number of Crew and Cannons determines how many dice you roll in combat).&#10;&#10;There is also an island with a Pub that offers useful strategy cards to help you in all aspects of the game. The last island is treasure island which offers no real bounty other than the chance to bury treasures that you have in the hull of your ship. Buried treasure is converted to Fame (which is the ultimate goal of the game).&#10;&#10;Other random elements of the game include the dreaded Legendary Pirates who are highly dangerous ships that patrol the islands in order. One of 5 different Legendary Pirates (which include famous names like Blackbeard and The Flying Dutchman) is drawn at the beginning of every game, and stays until defeated. If you end up at the same island as one of them, you had better have a strong ship and helpful allies or they will blast you with their powerful cannons. However, if you can manage to sink their ships, you can score a good amount of fame!

Set in the not-so-distant future, battles are now fought by machines of destruction, known as MODs, for short.  Human commanders still lead these mechanized troops, but these commanders each have special powers and abilities.  These come into play via the use of Command cards, which add a new dimension to the game.  Now the battle is not just for the continents, but the sea and moon are also battlegrounds.&#10;&#10;Although much has been added, the basic flavor of the game is still Risk.  One welcome change is the institution of a five-turn game limit, which allows the game to play to completion in about three hours.  Further, players must also factor in economics in the form of energy.  This energy is used to purchase command cards, bid for turn order, and hire new commanders.  There is much more strategy and planning involved in this new version, but it should still appeal to the classic Risk fans.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;     Risk&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,5,240,240,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Auction / Bidding', 'Dice Rolling', 'Variable Player Powers']",10,240,2.7185,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Science Fiction', 'Territory Building', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1045,12,56,111,0.17254541638484033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16823744471394045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18826064366114675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14285522770063966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18066448094946294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19845413560700598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17254541638484033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13772940762492766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1914340493302284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1789322788402085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3613289618989259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12758183573393345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18155351093995023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.159424853587138,0.12432099943671668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14285522770063966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5916415597612766,0.16755404800622298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12045533229196556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11351619507893167,0.14903145712502527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16687982468601734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
556,1721,915,Mystery of the Abbey,1995,6.29365,"Mystery of the Abbey is a whodunit deduction game in the spirit of Clue. A monk has been murdered in a medieval French Abbey. Players maneuver their way through the Abbey examining clues and questioning each other to find out who is the culprit.&#10;&#10;Monks are of three orders, fat-thin, bald-hatted, bearded-clean shaven. One monk card is hidden, and the rest of the cards are distributed.  Turns consist of moving up to two spaces, and then asking a question of any other monks who are present there. (For instance, &quot;how many fat monks do you have?&quot;.) Players may either take a &quot;vow of silence&quot; or answer truthfully; they then in turn get to ask the accuser a question.  &quot;Mass&quot; occurs every four turns: all players go back to the Sanctuary, an event card is read, and they then pass an ever growing number of cards to their left neighbor. Various rooms have special events or cards associated with them, e.g. in a Cell you get to pick a card from a neighbor, in the Cryptorum you get to pick up a card to take an extra turn later. Unlike Clue you don't automatically win by making a correct Accusation: you get 4 points for getting it right, but you also get 2 points for each correct Declaration of a single trait, and lose points for incorrect declarations and accusations. So, e.g. a person could correctly Declare the culprit but lose the game.  Unique Events cards add randomness to each play, and the game begs for House rules to limit the questions.&#10;&#10;",3,6,60,90,"['Area Movement', 'Deduction', 'Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Hand Management', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Set Collection']",8,90,2.202,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Deduction', 'Medieval', 'Murder / Mystery', 'Religious']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1502,18,65,155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14654209813625937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13594809992774054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16488529671947036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12940585749948963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16770895588552254,0.12704033374357096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17072749970296025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14199238886818663,0.0,0.11359869635639873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5503749887279278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1509524581451311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15973210847817698,0.0,0.16054991793185697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31024484903365107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16770895588552254,0.10446126281074464,0.0,0.10853969874760035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16488529671947036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1080396757977468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14253589314812856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12407299125660605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16138330564167294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1696980043949963,0.12443308820209488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10492180950429218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2556294347111519,0.0,0.0,0.12407299125660605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13365692033906582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12940585749948963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11964298529684482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Colors, shapes, and shadings come in three different types: green, purple and red; oval, diamond and squiggle; and solid, shaded and outlined.&#10;&#10;All players compete simultaneously and try to claim sets of cards in a single pass through the deck. A set consists of three cards that are either all alike or all different in each attribute. For example, if all three cards have the same number of objects, but three different shapes, shadings, and colors, then those cards are a set; if two of the cards have a common attribute that is not shared by the third, they are not a set.&#10;&#10;To play, one person takes the deck and lays out twelve cards face up. The first person to spot a set collects those three cards; if the player was mistaken, then this player cannot claim a set until after another player has done so.

560,1765,494,Ave Caesar,1989,6.28101,"Set in the Roman stadium Circus Maximus, in Ave Caesar, players use cards to move their chariots around a quasi-variable track. The track itself has bottlenecks and lane-changing restrictions, which make the race interesting for the racers (very similar to Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix or Daytona 500). Players are required to race three laps, and they must stop to 'Hail Caesar' before they can finish (a pit stop). The game is light, but if you waste too many moves taking the longer, outside-routes on corners, you may not have enough movement to finish the race. Later, the game was revamped into Ausgebremst, with the most notable changes being modular boards and options to reduce the luck.&#10;&#10;The Cafe Games/Pro Ludo edition has only 2 different tracks compared to the Ravensburger edition with 2 track variants on both sides of the board.&#10;&#10;It was re-released in 2022 by DiceTree Games with deluxe components, new maps, and new variants (by the designer).&#10;&#10;",2,6,30,30,"['Hand Management', 'Race', 'Track Movement']",12,30,1.3562,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Ancient', 'Miniatures', 'Racing']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,986,7,50,119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14761329309676974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10802715805628514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2904491512613618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15557889513412718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26515324660091455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17699945819771778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18073061852160183,0.0,0.12494955532685978,0.0,0.11575372726440471,0.0,0.12027305001043977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13993046760457806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5257089381847964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1199952202697346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18477305540164232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1680108954054007,0.0,0.0,0.11626405994585057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5309983745931534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10956637168616307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Up to five players can play on two different teams. The Axis which has Germany and Japan, and the Allies which has the USA, the United Kingdom, and the USSR. A full map of the world is provided, broken up in various chunks similar to Risk. The game comes with gobs of plastic miniatures that represent various military units during WWII.  Players have at their disposal infantry, armor, fighters, bombers, battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines, troop transports, anti-air guns, and factories. All of the units perform differently and many have special functions. Players have to work together with their teammates in order to coordinate offenses and decide how best to utilize their production points. Players also have the option of risking production resources on the possibility of developing a super technology that might turn the tide of war.&#10;&#10;Axis and Allies was originally published by Nova Games in 1981.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Axis & Allies Anniversary Edition&#10;     Axis &amp; Allies: Global 1940 (Axis & Allies: Pacific 1940 combined with Axis & Allies: Europe 1940)&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Totally Untested Volume 2 of Max's Advanced Rules for Axis & Allies (Unofficial expansion)&#10;    Conquest of the Pacific (Unofficial expansion)&#10;    Midway (Unofficial expansion)&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,5,180,180,"['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Minimap Resolution', 'Stat Check Resolution', 'Team-Based Game']",12,180,3.038,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,"['Economic', 'Wargame', 'World War II']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1495,11,107,139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18349254784342184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14693556824408815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17859763640766332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10788730347722088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14503656437258564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5174480918505979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1327649760925774,0.0,0.0,0.3755984842117084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1324049863882302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18893855095793202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1156038696814324,0.17953782890430892,0.0,0.0,0.16854407220934833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12298317159099671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15097277168729273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13730752937766388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15367841363770002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18453384372237044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13770603691279099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16560872549375313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2958275017006529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18247317561990412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1628412069953822,0.13536275421660945,0.0

On a turn, the active player can play a card, draw a card, or quit. To play a card, you must play the same number as the top card of the discard pile or one number higher. If a 6 is on the discard pile, you can play a 6 or a llama, and if a llama is on top, you can play another llama or a 1. If you quit, you place your remaining cards face down and take no further actions in the round. If all players have quit but one, that player can continue to play, but cannot draw more cards.&#10;&#10;The round ends when one player empties their hand or all players have quit. In either case, players collect tokens based on the cards in their hand. Each different number card in hand gets you white tokens (each worth 1 point) equal to the value of the card while one or more llamas gets you a black token (worth 10 points).

566,1859,361,Hare & Tortoise,1973,6.25363,"As the first winner of the Spiel des Jahres award in 1979, Hare and Tortoise or the German Hase und Igel (for Hare and Hedgehog) will always be regarded as a classic game.  It is a cunningly designed race to the finish in which your fuel (carrots) must practically run out (all but 10 carrots or fewer) at the moment you hit the finish line.  You also have three lettuce cards you must spend during the course of the race.  The farther you move, the more carrots you spend, and there are a variety of ways to gain or lose carrots as you go around the track.  It's a very clever exercise in arithmetic which David Parlett has fashioned into an entertaining and unique perennial favorite.&#10;&#10;There have several variations between the multiple prints of Hare &amp; Tortoise by different publishers.  Most variations come from methods of adding randomness that favor lagging player via cards, dice, or dice charts when landing on a Hare square.&#10;&#10;&#10;      Parlett Strategic Variant -- The designer's preferred way of playing the Hare square is that &quot;... you can land on them [Hare square], but must miss a turn. This would be the equivalent of the hare taking a nap, as in Aesop's fable.

As your intrepid adventurers delve through the ruins, they will face deadly traps guarding the ancient relics they prize.&#10;&#10;User Summary:&#10;&#10;A very light dice-roller, basically a fun simulation of Indiana-Jones-style temple robbers. Players move through a Mayan temple, risking constant death while trying to get to the exit, carrying as much treasure as they dare. The more treasure cards you have, the fewer actions you might get this round. If your character gets killed, a second one can drop in and you may still get enough treasure and escape to win.&#10;&#10;The temple starts with a room of crushing walls, leading into a winding passage that takes you past a lava pit and locked alcoves. The passage goes on, with two short-cuts that might save you time; a fast river or a rickety wooden bridge. You must balance attempts to grab treasure from the rooms, as you pass through, with staying ahead of a massive boulder, tumbling down the passage after you. If you have to let the boulder pass or be crushed to death, then you're forced to jump in the river and risk drowning just to get ahead. Otherwise, the boulder reaches the exit before you, blocking it and you're trapped forever.&#10;&#10;A mix of very basic lucky dice-rolling, lucky card draw for the treasure, and some decision-making about possible risks. Beautifully produced, with 12 small but detailed plastics miniatures, and an exotic and deadly temple. Adults may tire from repeats of The Adventurers, but kids will get lots of thrills.&#10;&#10;",2,6,45,45,"['Action Points', 'Bias', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Memory', 'Push Your Luck', 'Variable Player Powers']",10,45,1.6613,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Ancient', 'Exploration', 'Miniatures']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1657,14,79,171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0855330422739112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11559400085479857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18787554046562943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09479550063506308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10413047055902938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09479550063506308,0.0,0.2369349243023213,0.11907400150898757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12511281779099573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40819299743344506,0.11787205258622502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.124383598094764,0.0,0.0,0.1609998487566008,0.0,0.22590884690320417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09365682552667447,0.0,0.11671303970790933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09508652420783395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09815001564321475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08068695031885673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1222893933755684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11004660650263272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11614869659901482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11146795390055052,0.12740428093441566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09175550871370126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07549790271013543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6370214046720785,0.0,0.10824342535620798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08873482587404959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This is tricky as each player's color is chosen at random and kept hidden until the end of the game. Each of the 12 regions of the board contains five areas, each area containing one of four different terrain types. Each area receives one hut each of five different colors. On their turn, a player moves all huts from one area containing less than seven to an adjacent occupied area, all the while trying to hide which color is theirs. After moving, if one or more areas are completely surrounded by empty areas, they are scored. If all colors are present in a scoring, any colors with only one hut present are removed. The epoch track allows a limited number of areas to score before the game ends, and each scoring can gain a bonus or score nothing depending on the terrain type in which scoring occurred and how far along the track the game has progressed; each scoring advances the track, and each section of the track gives different terrain types bonuses and penalties.&#10;&#10;Once at least twelve areas have scored the game ends, then players reveal their colors to find out who was best able to score the most points while keeping their color a secret.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,30,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Enclosure', 'Hidden Roles']",10,30,2.0221,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Abstract Strategy', 'Bluffing', 'Deduction', 'Prehistoric']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1278,9,33,122,0.0,0.09768513891890601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09925883477752405,0.08763520841450186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08036736479137561,0.0,0.0,0.09434053319042993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10463326733646722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.362323078433441,0.39489524575386975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10036244256757453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17702898716479792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05842503037804445,0.14849377962474997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08594783814140956,0.14523333448339154,0.06876116702690685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08467131371036048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09525382212655635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06323028846595237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09980489029942968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06539629794478076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1021091912389644,0.0,0.0,0.10463326733646722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2132430147916199,0.0,0.4568567915196355,0.0,0.09479324087318897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09572255568244961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38674268430578745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17668291411230708,0.0,0.0971806902469508,0.18958648174637793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07034532555289458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
569,1887,158900,Samurai Spirit,2014,6.24589,"You and your fellow samurai companions are the only standing obstacle between one frightened village and a full horde of blood-thirsty villains. The fight seems unfair as the seven of you might not seem to measure up to the dozens of enemies who want to slice you to pieces &mdash; but this comparison doesn't take into account your strong combat skills and an efficient team spirit that binds your samurai squad enough to face the threat. Above all else, when everything seems desperate and lost, your enemies will discover that inside each of you lies a true beast, a warrior spirit ready to unleash its full power!&#10;&#10;Samurai Spirit is a co-operative game in which each player is a fierce samurai defending a village surrounded by a horde of bandits. The game plays out over three turns during which each player takes turns drawing bandit cards, then choosing whether they want to fight the bandit, defend the village, or let the bandit pass in order to help the other samurai.&#10;&#10;The challenge of the game consists of balancing your choices: Should you fight each enemy to quickly reach your beast capacities, while also coming closer to the death and risking further loss by not defending the village sufficiently? Should you mainly defend or help the other samurai, taking the risk of remaining human too long and therefore weaker, when you know that weakness will be a major problem when facing the lieutenant and the villain bosses? Each enemy presents a tough choice to you, your team, and ultimately the whole village! Each turn ends with farms and fences being destroyed, and since those aren't unlimited, you must do what's necessary to end the game with at least one undamaged farm and enough farmers to tend it.

573,1922,27627,Talisman: Revised 4th Edition,2007,6.23653,"Theme:&#10;&#10;Talisman is an adventure board game set in a high fantasy medieval world.  Players have 14 characters to choose from all based on role playing archetypes, such as heroes, wizards, villains, thieves, monsters, etc.  The game makes players feel they are traveling the world to find equipment, weapons, ancient relics, and companions that will help them on their quest to acquire the Crown of Command.  Along the way they visit various locales in the worlds, battle each other and fantastic creatures to make their way to the top.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;&#10;Each player is trying to move from the outer world and ultimately to the inner world. Players wander the outer, middle, and inner worlds trying to acquire equipment, weapons, and companions.  They will also improve statistics with equipment, companions, and encounters and battles with fantasy creatures and each other.  Once they complete a Talisman quest, players will enter the inner world and face its challenges to finally reach the Portal of Power to claim the Crown of Command.  Then the other players must race to stop this player before he eventually kills them all with the Command spell.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;To begin, players select a character card from among the 14 provided.  Characters have basic statistics to start.  These are Life [hit points], Strength [physical prowess], and Craft [Magic and Intelligence].  Some characters are naturally more gifted in combat and others in magic, while others are mix of the two.  Additionally characters are often differentiated with unique abilities, starting equipment, and starting spells.  This all makes the players actually feel different during play.  In addition items and companions players acquire during play also add to statistics, increasing Strength, Craft, Life or adding new abilities, etc.&#10;&#10;Actual game play is relatively simple, making the game easy to pick up with novices.  On a player's turn they throw a die for movement.  Player then chooses which direction, left or right, or if meeting qualifications may be able to move from outer to middle world, or middle to inner world.  Once on space, player follows instructions on space, or encounters face up cards already in space, or other player if in space.  Most spaces have a player draw a number of cards to encounter.  These can be creatures, companions, weapons, equipment, treasure, or relics.  Players must fight creatures and win before acquiring any other items or companions.  If another player is in the space, players may attack with either Craft or Strength but are not required to do so.  The defender defends with same statistic attacked with.  If the defender loses, he loses a life and an item or companion of attackers choice.  If the attacker loses, he loses a life.&#10;&#10;Players start in the outer world, and build up their character's statistics and items to try and move to the middle world.  There are two ways to move up to the middle world, one requiring a test of strength and the other a boat man's ride for a price.  Once in the middle world, play proceeds in the same manner, but the challenge generally is increased with more threats such as the desert and temple.  However, there is more potential for encounters and items as most spaces now draw more than one card.&#10;&#10;In the middle world, players may also acquire a Talisman quest, that once completed, will grant them a Talisman.  The Talisman is required to unlock the Crown of Command and pass through the Portal of Power in the Inner World.&#10;&#10;Once players have a Talisman and have enough Strength or Craft to enter the Portal of Power, they will try to enter the Inner World.  There they must face and survive the guardians there, like the Vampire's Tower and Werewolf before claiming the Crown of Command.  Once a player claims the Crown of Command, they can cast the Command Spell, automatically forcing a player to lose a life.  It then becomes a race for the Crown as the other players try to take the player with the Crown down before he finishes them all off.&#10;&#10;Revised using:&#10;&#10;    Talisman: Upgrade Pack&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,6,90,90,"['Dice Rolling', 'Role Playing', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Take That', 'Variable Player Powers']",13,90,2.1713,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,4155,37,181,265,0.10603995686408062,0.05693180916004241,0.22426440845725817,0.0,0.0,0.05169621933218966,0.05849216667272422,0.0,0.05916333311516349,0.0,0.0,0.05107461602011752,0.05986501740463306,0.0,0.0,0.04389673890089833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048125793817587165,0.05551481507924813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04110398992823536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10996508355509342,0.21395089280126062,0.04327177919083384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06098124314218013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05882410196286503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05047708090402782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05472313405603287,0.03439138107257262,0.0,0.09017937843570097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04565100184346562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04952988827698109,0.11832666623032698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13526906765355146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050091200902596236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057848973769627166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048465024969885626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04779385852744635,0.05634930998874348,0.0,0.05169621933218966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23946006961853225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05663781177373954,0.0,0.28768578591226435,0.0457945786565595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05472313405603287,0.0,0.0,0.03977877275874995,0.05916333311516349,0.0,0.0,0.11486990040544606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05723151558880248,0.17819230355185045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03811357178348607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10893602852468824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04232167028676245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1508488049907068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11157599472625669,0.0,0.057848973769627166,0.0,0.0,0.050282934996902263,0.0471506656243493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03820151729839597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05723151558880248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25848109666094826,0.11973003480926613,0.0,0.0,0.08285334396604563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05421704294230139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060600127578541316,0.14338157558233908,0.10297244861813093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04376970611706626,0.0,0.0,0.047468911870482265,0.0,0.0,0.0471506656243493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09130200368693124,0.058167220015760135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042206915883738365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6040967452663272,0.0

Whoever collects all of his treasures first and returns to his home space wins!&#10;&#10;Labyrinth is simple at first glance and an excellent puzzle-solving game for children; it can also be played by adults using more strategy and more of a cutthroat approach.&#10;&#10;",2,4,20,20,"['Map Deformation', 'Modular Board', 'Network and Route Building', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Slide / Push', 'Square Grid', 'Tile Placement']",8,20,1.3437,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"[""Children's Game"", 'Maze', 'Puzzle']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,936,6,32,99,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14873144113087713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1597176458455148,0.0,0.0,0.13520294052907272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13943520631356232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17327817326514527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1214304548025103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17223329726883888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11444462042396636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1281660363565259,0.16734868760768176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13133918458557775,0.0,0.0,0.1702145323196829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10965379153893559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11587256278624343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1605035987700767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10990681319782125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512338034778008,0.0,0.164656640303416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14873144113087713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14812727968884057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15388564690336645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4373688755261457,0.5270090360615861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12972427276395615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1365693616015612,0.0,0.0,0.13565375842141966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14873144113087713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10202274977676865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
575,1957,124172,Tsuro of the Seas,2012,6.22598,"The basic game play of Tsuro of the Seas resembles that of Tom McMurchie's Tsuro: Players each have a ship that they want to sail &mdash; that is, keep on the game board &mdash; as long as possible. Whoever stays on the board the longest wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn players add &quot;wake&quot; tiles to the 7&times;7 game board; each tile has two &quot;wake connections&quot; on each edge, and as the tiles are placed on the board, they create a connected network of paths. If a wake is placed in front of a ship, that ship then sails to the end of the wake. If the ship goes off the board, that player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;What's new in Tsuro of the Seas are daikaiju tiles, representing sea monsters and other creatures of the deep. Notably, daikaiju can move: each tile has five arrows, four for moving in each of the cardinal directions and another one for rotation. On the active player's turn, he rolls two six-sided dice; on a sum of 6, 7, or 8, the daikaiju will move, while on any other sum they'll stay in place. To determine which direction the daikaiju tiles move, the player then makes a second roll, this time with a single die. On 1-5 in the second roll, each daikaiju moves according to its matching arrow. On a 6 in the second roll, a new daikaiju tile is added to the board.&#10;&#10;If a daikaiju tile hits a wake tile, a ship, or another daikaiju tile, the object hit is removed from the game. Another way to be ousted!

Players take turns pushing the marbles around the board, with the goal of pushing six of the opposing player's marbles off the board.

What's more, the king has declared that at this feast, he will choose his new Hand &mdash; and you have a chance of rising to this lofty position. Of course, you're not the only one with eyes set on becoming the power behind the Iron Throne. In A Game of Thrones: Hand of the King, you need to scheme and backstab to outwit your opponents, and you need the help of Varys, the Master of Whispers, to do it.&#10;&#10;Hand of the King is a fast-paced card game of conspiracies and sudden twists of fate for two to four players, challenging each of you to gain the most support among the twisted intrigues of the King&rsquo;s Landing court. Each turn, you send Varys to do your bidding, moving through the court and inciting iconic characters from A Song of Ice and Fire to support your cause.

Possess as many characters from a House as someone else, and you claim the banner from that person. Collect the final character from a House, and you immediately use the power of one of six companions; since the game contains fourteen companions, the mix of powers will differ each game.&#10;&#10;",2,4,15,30,"['Grid Movement', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection']",14,30,1.23,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Abstract Strategy', 'Card Game', 'Fantasy']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1606,10,63,151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11792626245984625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14221292617236617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39417930312288924,0.25564179434789513,0.10340761033651075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14572834181078348,0.11581803454240225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13978013597168093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1240484495045022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11382382200844718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14306087034845216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13465929987185618,0.0,0.14392876797224596,0.0,0.0,0.09576735111962893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11792626245984625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3703114539906678,0.22842826394027263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08806420104162505,0.0,0.0,0.09236025845830165,0.12839275277133883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10645760721665809,0.1390036031386928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2238638456942779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12109615850185687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24032467561847776,0.0,0.13331791760489198,0.11156491536944384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12016233780923888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09129108367914751,0.0,0.13331791760489198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2878575359444919,0.0,0.11382382200844718,0.0,0.14392876797224596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08335692691373742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

On a turn, a player lays down one or more ingredient cards of a single type into a common stack, then optionally adds a pizza order card to that stack. He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck.&#10;&#10;After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up. If enough ingredient cards are available to fill that order, the owner scores it; if not, the player can make up the difference by playing cards from his hand (and thereby scoring the order) or else return the card to the bottom of his order deck.&#10;&#10;Once all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play.

581,2043,155695,Age of War,2014,6.20309,"Age of War is a quick-playing game of conquest. Fourteen cards are laid out at the start of the game, each showing one castle and the symbols required to conquer this castle, with the symbols separated into battle lines. Each castle belongs to a clan, with some clans having only a single castle and some having up to four castles.&#10;&#10;A player starts his turn by rolling seven dice, the six sides of which show archery, cavalry, daimyo, and 1-3 infantry. He then selects a card and uses the symbols rolled to conquer exactly one of the battle lines on this card (by placing the appropriate dice on that line). If he can do this, he then rolls the remaining dice, ideally conquering another line; if he can't conquer a line, he removes one die from play, then rolls again. His turn ends when either he conquers every line on the card (in which case he claims it) or he no longer has dice available to roll.&#10;&#10;Each card is worth a number of victory points. You can conquer cards owned by other players, but you need to conquer an additional daimyo line in the process. If a player owns all the castles of one clan, however, those castles are secure and cannot be stolen. What's more, these castles are now worth more points because you've united the clan under one ruler (you) and strengthened your hold over Japan.&#10;&#10;When the last card is claimed, players tally their points, and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",2,6,15,30,"['Dice Rolling', 'Push Your Luck', 'Re-rolling and Locking', 'Set Collection', 'Take That']",14,30,1.1138,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Dice', 'Medieval']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1444,12,65,146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11955255481879061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09544788425839755,0.0,0.0,0.1057560196538925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24141983103906522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13095856469388348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38861879828592627,0.11898850567075059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.099262306251771,0.0,0.0,0.09408898873299038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09744780304424219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08713723478533623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11788807481285245,0.11240686399404931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10809837479862754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.650844390202234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10184512912883707,0.0,0.08287312177055269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11955255481879061,0.0,0.0,0.09202309757616864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114997781185248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09007703742122955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12130391570419576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12379098920302027,0.1035665389776191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09007703742122955,0.11528521005145906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08914475151875888,0.0,0.12647723322297638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11240686399404931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07710580406710893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24888532554480503

It's best to bid just a little bit more than your opponent, but just how much did he bid?&#10;&#10;reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;Kuhhandel Master (2009)&#10;&#10;",3,5,45,45,"['Auction: Turn Order Until Pass', 'Betting and Bluffing', 'Hand Management', 'Memory', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Trading']",10,45,1.6269,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Animals', 'Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Humor']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,688,8,39,82,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19976303377148508,0.0,0.1579568575163302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16854366836445214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21289176401374574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1816353851295916,0.19420452655355755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2774950261638644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16224953820188828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20174677037308497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2027658580545109,0.39018633007467435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2194332830947702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19976303377148508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19078567994802237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2154166860947098,0.0,0.1371468628053217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2194332830947702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13746332360663968,0.20074604563458204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20486190757682202,0.17439525658105196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19509316503733717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17198014910900344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12760251944127143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
584,2086,140,Pit,1903,6.19107,"Pit is an open-outcry commodity trading game. The first edition in 1903 had a deck of 63 cards, 9 each of 7 commodities, each with a value (ranging from 40 for Flax to 100 for Wheat). Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (&ldquo;One! One! One!&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Three! Three! Three!&rdquo;) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring &ldquo;Corner on Wheat!&rdquo; or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.&#10;&#10;The 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10.&#10;&#10;Pit&rsquo;s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt&rsquo;s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit.  In addition, the only related patent assigned to Gavitt is US746492 A, filed October 7, 1903, and granted December 8, 1903.  Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse', a remarkably similar open-outcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80-card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities, and Panic, using a 65 card deck with 8 each of 8 commodities and a Panic card, roughly equivalent to the Bull.  Pit, however, seems to have cornered the market on open-outcry games, as neither of its competitors were seen again after 1904.&#10;&#10;",3,8,30,90,"['Commodity Speculation', 'Negotiation', 'Real-Time', 'Set Collection', 'Trading']",7,90,1.1542,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Economic', 'Party Game']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1780,20,95,165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16270539247669538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13481328112256813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3217692015174458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.257211874891507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15754720534168062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11740534168478393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21552300704720356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1438013692169748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15674469111066136,0.15442340897165385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15442340897165385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10601904508715275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2797401819401643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16091624771271057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16362872400519576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30887847368086585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26408486386024205,0.29120605828496965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16962915999813655,0.0,0.13577811411520713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4102953873254964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Attend to business at the Trader's Guild or the Masoner's Hall. Break for lunch at the Sushi Shop, or stop off for a drink at the Pub. Don't forget to check out the Wizard's Traveling Imaginarium before you go! But no matter where you go, keep on the lookout for a bargain... the denizens of this town are always wheeling and dealing! Collect and trade resources as you visit the various buildings of Harbour, and cash them in to buy your way into the town. Whoever has the most points worth of buildings when the game ends, wins!&#10;&#10;Harbour is a worker placement game where players move their worker from building to building, collecting and trading Fish, Livestock, Wood, and Stone; and cashing those resources in to purchase buildings (which are the worker placement spots) from the central pool. Once a building is purchased, it is replaced from the deck, and the central pool is a small subset of the deck, and is therefore different every game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has purchased his fourth building. After that round finishes, the player with the most points worth of buildings is the winner!&#10;&#10;At the heart of Harbour is a dynamic market mechanism. Each time a player purchases a building, the value of the resources they used drops, while the value of the other resources rise.

588,2138,34585,Keltis,2008,6.17691,"Keltis is a multi-player game based on Lost Cities, with some rules changes, later published with Knizia's original rules and theme as Lost Cities: The Board Game.&#10;&#10;Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. Cards show one of five different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards in either ascending or descending order. As in Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths since the final spaces on a path grant high points, but ending early gives negative ones.&#10;&#10;The active player plays one card (out of a hand of eight) or discards one, then moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus: either immediate points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wishing stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when five playing pieces (from any combination of players) have reached the seventh (or higher) space on their respective paths. Now, scoring happens: &#10;&#10;     Pieces that moved only 1-3 steps earn negative points (-4, -3, -2).&#10;     Pieces with 4+ steps earn points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10). &#10;     One piece of each player twice the height of other pieces scores double, either positive or negative. &#10;     Holding fewer than two wish stones earns negative points (-3 / -4), while a collection of five or more stones yields a bonus of 10 points.&#10;&#10;&#10;All endgame points are added to any scored during the game. The player with the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;&#10;Primary differences between Lost Cities: The Board Game and Keltis:&#10;&#10;1. In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.&#10;&#10;2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, high to low, or low to high. In LCBG, you must go low to high.&#10;&#10;Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above. Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.&#10;&#10;There are more differences that are non-substantive.

Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses.  But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word.

Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice&mdash;just when it seems like things can't get any worse, they do. But some say that one's reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope&mdash;if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond.&#10;&#10;In the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins.&#10;&#10;Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You'll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have.

To complete a construction, the player must add enough workers to cover the four characteristics of the building.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with 10 ecu and an apprentice. Five workers and five buildings are placed face-up on the table, with the others set aside in separate decks. On a turn, you can take three free actions, then pay 5 ecu for each additional action. The possible actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Open a site - Take one of the five buildings, place it front of you, then draw a replacement from the deck.&#10;    Recruit a worker - Take one of the five workers, place it front of you, then draw a replacement from the deck.&#10;    Assign a worker to a building - Pay the cost of the worker (as he won't work for free!), then place him on a building; when the building's needs are met, you earn the points and coins indicated, then flip the building over.

600,2342,559,Metro,1997,6.12718,"Similar to Streetcar, Tsuro, Tantrix and Spaghetti Junction, this game has players putting square tiles onto the board to form rail lines. The major difference in this game, however, is that players are not striving to make short, direct routes like those sought in Streetcar. Instead, the object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible.  Players start with a number of trains ringing the board.  Whenever a tile placement connects a train to a station (either on the edge or the center of the board), that train is removed and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses, which can cause one tile to score multiple times if the track loops around.  However, players score double for city connections, which are the stations in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;For those interested in graph theory, a key part of the Metro game design is that the routes will always connect a starting subway train station with an empty destination station, rather than routing to another starting subway train station. The tiles implement a design principle which allows any tile to be placed on any open grid space, subject to rules for alignment with existing tile edges.

603,2371,66171,Dragonheart,2010,6.12001,"Dragons, knights, trolls, princesses, dwarves, and other fantasy characters make up the world of Dragonheart. Dragons are searching for treasure, of course, but they're being pursued by dragon hunters, and those are the two sides that face off in this game. On a turn, a player plays one or more cards with the same motif, then refills his hand to five cards. The cards are always played onto the part of the game board that has the same motif. By laying out cards, a player collects point cards that are already present. This is how the dragon collects treasure cards, for example, but the third dragon hunter defeats the dragon, while a second knight protects the princess.

607,2409,88408,Nightfall,2011,6.11076,"The sun has retreated from the earth. It has been a little over a week since the last hint of light shone over the horizon, and the chaos has begun. People fear for their existence, while scientists struggle to explain the phenomenon.&#10;&#10;Until they came.&#10;&#10;The creatures of nightmare &mdash; vampires, werewolves, and ghouls &mdash; have begun to appear throughout the world, and they show no sign of hesitation in claiming the dark world as their own!&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;Publisher Blurb&#10;&#10;Nightfall - a new fast, furious and fun deck-building game from Alderac Entertainment Group. Featuring direct head-to-head combat, amazing art, a new AEG world, and unique mechanics by designer David Gregg, Nightfall will be the deck-building game to own.&#10;&#10;Before the game begins, there is a draft to determine which cards are available for purchase, and by whom. During this draft players select two cards from the set for their personal archives, and they also select cards to put into the common area. The cards drafted into personal archives may only be purchased by the player who drafted them.&#10;&#10;After the table has been set with the private and common cards, players begin play.&#10;&#10;The meat of Nightfall is in the chaining mechanic, which was partially developed with the help of people right here on BoardGameGeek.&#10;&#10;Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.&#10;&#10;Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.&#10;&#10;The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck. But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!&#10;&#10;Nightfall's base set releases with starting decks of 12 cards for up to 5 players, and 24 distinct cards (7 copies of each) for drafting during play.&#10;&#10;The box contains card dividers, and is in the same format as the much heralded Wrath of the Elements box for Thunderstone.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Nightfall: Martial Law&#10;    Nightfall: Blood Country&#10;    Nightfall: The Coldest War&#10;    Nightfall: Dark Rages&#10;    Nightfall: Eastern Skies&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,5,45,45,"['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Delayed Purchase', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Pattern Building', 'Take That', 'Variable Player Powers']",12,45,2.6346,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Horror']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2697,21,179,229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10847022078835293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0959526027607074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09735281094992125,0.0,0.11955266173109302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21591691622057907,0.0,0.16977512599433697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10552122469124901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20829469044371404,0.22701999366873588,0.1160488970008701,0.20919690435503666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11539405106168647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30427388713458875,0.0,0.0,0.1174024159462157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06717553664743951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11116659758073248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1174024159462157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07660740908428784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11881891146535885,0.0,0.09428829987115098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19615565052611175,0.0,0.10952029597019686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12030453110630371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07553890778231923,0.15249411951877148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10952029597019686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11671813630481088,0.0,0.29990905790151184,0.077341159350022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2139200709285742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09210126640199116,0.2348048318924314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09919877991576821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09919877991576821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22609324060929137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11881891146535885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09561238511427538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11671813630481088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10414734522185702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08634940351736024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11475299238222532,0.09006084639019697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2553791435483944,0.0

609,2419,21632,To Court the King,2006,6.10958,"In this game, the players are petitioners at the royal court, trying to gain the King's favor. To do so, they must first gain the help of the servants and petty officials at the court, who can then help them gain access to the nobility, who, in turn, can help to reach the king.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns. On their turn, a player will gather their dice, roll them, set aside at least one, and roll the remaining dice again, until all dice have been set aside. After that, they select a character who will help. Each character requires a certain combination of dice (such as two pairs or dice that show at least 30 points).

Now, all players try to gain a dice result of as many equal dice as possible (7x 2s, 8x 6s, etc).

614,2442,36946,Red November,2008,6.10164,"Red November is a cooperative game in a gnomish attack submarine where everything is going wrong. The sub is descending and the water pressure increasing, the nuclear reactor is overheating, the nuclear missile launchers are pre-igniting, fires and water leaks are everywhere, there's a giant Kraken looming nearby and there&rsquo;s very little oxygen and vodka left. While the storyline feels more and more like a disaster movie, the players must get organized to solve the problems, divide the tasks among themselves to minimize the risks, and sometimes accept to sacrifice themselves for the common cause.&#10;&#10;The game is played on the map of the submarine. The conditions in the submarine are represented by three disaster tracks: Asphyxiation, Heat and Pressure. During the game, these conditions get worse, and if anyone of them reaches its maximum value, the submarine is lost. In addition, various emergencies can occur which have to be dealt with swiftly, or they'll also lead to the loss of the submarine.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player can move to a new location, and perform some action there. Such an action can be repairs (which will improve conditions on the sub and/or fix emergencies), removing obstacles (unblocking hatches, removing flooding or extinguishing fires) or stocking up on equipment (which will help with later actions). Each action is paid for with time. The more time a player spends on an action, the greater the chance of success. After each player's turn, a number of events will happen; the more time was spent, the more events will occur. Such events will be the worsening of conditions in the submarine, or the triggering of emergencies.&#10;&#10;If the Gnomes can keep alive long enough, rescue will arrive and the game is won.&#10;&#10;",1,8,60,120,"['Area Movement', 'Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Turn Order: Time Track']",13,120,2.0722,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Fantasy', 'Humor', 'Nautical']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1779,14,75,159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5453955596419436,0.12963990191274566,0.0,0.18638586164421492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18334271455550175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1578274738102955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2474744203732467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1522955980205428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15961610198614046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17955762784568716,0.0,0.18047694160753247,0.0,0.0,0.14592487314231822,0.0,0.19431732817807845,0.18852454008265718,0.17520240756230818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18236878462560902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14195287986898358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12144926955691505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283369951423902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16022706455440633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11794442209120205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34328981321451174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16679438604726549,0.0,0.1502460575390292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
615,2499,17240,That's Life!,2005,6.09107,"Lots of people grew up playing roll-and-move games, and That's Life!, a.k.a., Verflixxt!, is a modern roll-and-move design that puts you (a bit) more in control of your fate than those games of old.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, lay out the tiles in a continuous path, with the tiles either bearing a clover or being numbered -10 to +8. Place wooden guards on the clover tiles and two of the positive tiles as indicated in the rules. Each player has three tokens (two in a five- or six-player game) that start at the beginning of the path.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you roll the die, then move one of your tokens that many spaces down the path. If your token is the only one on a tile when you leave it, you collect that tile, which shrinks the path on which everyone is moving. If a guard is still on a tile when you leave it, you do not collect the tile. If any player's token is on the same space as a guard, you can move that guard instead of moving one of your own tokens, possibly setting someone else up for misfortune on a future turn and possibly setting yourself up for goods things &mdash; as long as no one else lands on your tile!&#10;&#10;Once your token reaches the final space on the path, that token is retired from play. Once all tokens are retired, players tally their points, with each clover you possess turning a negative tile into a positive one. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;Verflixxt! includes a number of variants, including one in which you construct the path by laying out the tiles at random instead of in a particular order. The 2020 version of Verflixxt! uses this variant for its basic set-up, with the addition of a double-sided &quot;give/steal&quot; tile placed after every eighth tile on the path. When you collect tiles in this version of play, you place them in a tower, with your most recently collected tile on top. When you are the last token to leave a &quot;give&quot; tile, you must give your topmost tile to another player, giving a negative token to whoever has the most positive token on top and vice versa; you then flip the &quot;give&quot; tile to its &quot;steal&quot; side. When you are the last token to leave a &quot;steal&quot; tile, you take the topmost tile from whichever player you choose, then place it on top of your stack.&#10;&#10;For an even trickier variant, you can play that the clover tile affects only the tile directly beneath it in your stack, turning a positive negative and a negative positive.

616,2500,105593,Cheating Moth,2011,6.09078,"Cheating is forbidden? Not in this naughty game of cards &ndash; in fact, you'll probably have to cheat in order to win.&#10;&#10;In Mogel Motte you want to get rid of all the cards in your hand before anyone else. Each player starts the round with a hand of eight cards, with one player (the oldest) receiving the guard bug &ndash; which stays on the table throughout the game &ndash; and one card being turnd face-up to start a discard pile. The cards are numbered 1-5, with the majority of them having only numbers; some cards have special abilities that come into play when added to the discard pile or in a player's hand.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player places one card from her hand onto the discard pile; that card must be numbered exactly one higher or lower than the card on top of the discard pile. (The numbers wrap, so a 1 can be played on a 5 and vice versa.) If a player can't play a card, she draws one from the deck and her turn ends.&#10;&#10;There's another way to rid yourself of cards, though: cheating! Throughout the round, you can make cards disappear by dropping them on the floor, hiding them up your sleeve and so on. You must keep your hand of cards above the table at all times, you can't vanish more than one card at once, and you can't rid yourself of your final card this way. The player with the guard bug &ndash; and only him! &ndash; can call out other players for cheating, and no one can cheat while the accusation is being resolved. If the accusation was false, the Guard must draw a card; otherwise the cheating player takes back the card she tried to lose, is given a card from the Guard's hand as additional punishment, and becomes the new Guard.&#10;&#10;Cheating is a necessity as the &quot;Cheating Moth&quot; cards can't be played onto the discard pile, but must be disappeared via cheating. (The Guard, however, can play these cards as the Guard is not allowed to cheat.)&#10;&#10;The action cards work as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Ant: After an ant is played, everyone but the active player must take a card from the draw pile.&#10;    Cockroach: After a cockroach is played, everyone races to play an identically-numbered card on top of it. Only the fastest player gets to leave her card in place.&#10;    Mosquito: After a mosquito is played, everyone but the active player must slap the pile of cards. Whoever is slowest receives a card from the hand of all other players.&#10;    Spider: After playing this, give a non-Cheating Moth card from your hand to another player.&#10;&#10;&#10;When one player has no cards in hand, the round ends. All other players score 10 points for each Cheating Moth in hand, 5 points for each action card, and 1 point for each number card. After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;",3,5,30,30,['Hand Management'],7,30,1.1519,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Action / Dexterity', 'Card Game']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2842,25,155,191,0.07068694521679822,0.0,0.0,0.11409484225766658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07330346094899763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11704744021581033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06393949281762393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07068694521679822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051406572332166264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3835465420737105,0.12022835488965712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07590225032526979,0.0,0.0798128428344803,0.0,0.1730715463615186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20676627557670546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06011417744482856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08029703796397697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05177078261111974,0.07474807809953794,0.0740130948423037,0.08079290156192713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5164866151935309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06892209185890182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0667822597963512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07295761510104115,0.0,0.0,0.05303359250500959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3081956132442058,0.0,0.0,0.15244057280006573,0.0,0.15775469588752192,0.0,0.0,0.05226664620906989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05081352426668859,0.0,0.07551028907303899,0.0,0.0,0.268476502196074,0.056423817540369604,0.0,0.06507665194311721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15350189459801442,0.06307295031548506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11046118763445584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058523720107905165,0.0,0.05523059381722792,0.07068694521679822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12922844053466467,0.058186379051789694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15775469588752192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07512565463006002,0.0,0.0,0.14456577530266548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06507665194311721,0.0,0.12172505390726279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06892209185890182,0.056270825433623516,0.0,0.0,0.047277302487943255,0.0,0.06920592178734021,0.0,0.0
617,2505,131835,Boss Monster: The Dungeon Building Card Game,2013,6.08933,"Inspired by a love of classic video games, Boss Monster: The Dungeon Building Card Game pits 2-4 players in a competition to build the ultimate side-scrolling dungeon. Players compete to lure and destroy hapless adventurers, racing to outbid one another to see who can build the most enticing, treasure-filled dungeon. The goal of Boss Monster is to be the first Boss to amass ten Souls, which are gained when a Hero is lured and defeated &mdash; but a player can lose if his Boss takes five Wounds from Heroes who survive his dungeon.&#10;&#10;Playing Boss Monster requires you to juggle two competing priorities: the need to lure Heroes at a faster rate than your opponents, and the need to kill those Heroes before they reach your Boss. Players can build one room per turn, each with its own damage and treasure value. More attractive rooms tend to deal less damage, so a Boss who is too greedy can become inundated with deadly Heroes.&#10;&#10;Players interact with each other by building rooms and playing Spells. Because different Heroes seek different treasure types, and rooms are built simultaneously (played face down, then revealed), this means that every &quot;build phase&quot; is a bidding war.

They can send fewer agents face-down or more agents face-up. Additionally they can play action cards like Assassins that take out opposing agents or scouts that reveal face-down agents. Players can decide if they want to refill their hand from the agent deck or the action card deck but once one of the decks is empty they don't have access to any more of these cards.&#10;&#10;After each players turn, a card from the voting stack is revealed and the group of officials that is indicated on the card casts their vote.

Players lay out cards in opposite three-column, four-row matrices. Cards on the leading edges of the opposing columns can be used to attack, which means the combat value of the cards are compared and the loser is destroyed. However, cards are played facedown until they're engaged, adding an element of bluff and doubt to the game. Each turn, players have as many actions as they have columns, and actions can be used to attack, draw cards, or play special action cards. To win, you need to reduce the other player to zero columns, capture their hostage card from their hand, or make sure your opponent cannot use all of their actions during their turn.&#10;&#10;Hera &amp; Zeus is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;",2,2,30,30,"['Action Points', 'Hand Management', 'Secret Unit Deployment']",12,30,2.0479,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Mythology']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,874,7,39,96,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16519821321505157,0.47120912032551376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22582223685419361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23252457228790854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2271037481056036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17407894180441688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15471724431443548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14956445758831483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.199584945311043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1535749478038134,0.0,0.1422723960579506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1808319688417883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20469561667079905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19877421203601342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15549112501634782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18913031363804003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16947328733212877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14289964370769698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13466754458419886,0.35360065377239464,0.0,0.20208550702099068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16294934343793357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The Pirate ships are worth 1-4 skulls (the player with the most skulls played on a trade ship captures it if the lead is kept for one full pass around the table). There are 4 Pirate Captains (1 of each color) to help win the battles and 1 Admiral to help defend the trade ships. The game is playable with 2-5 players individually. With partners it can be played with up to 6 or 8.&#10;&#10;",2,8,20,20,"['Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Hand Management', 'Team-Based Game']",10,20,1.3804,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Nautical', 'Pirates']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1189,13,49,112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12259605547755742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15809127464861567,0.0,0.28551920140672243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264336871805416,0.1377199496772949,0.15010071566008867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525921075704909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10058966057901998,0.0,0.12425668905856706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08971890799475032,0.0,0.1176282415036379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11288574796688619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15617354759020804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10130232798081826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45523319780836036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24936554812320666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10227260763084052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21013624526331123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10012146161700787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14412463505497042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264336871805416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47136298499578017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11010777365772195,0.0,0.0,0.09250972384669531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2986067393267256

623,2587,217,A la carte,1989,6.06934,"In one of his sillier games, Karl-Heinz Schmiel casts the players as semi-psychotic cooks attempting to hone their culinary skills. Each player receives a miniature pan and a hotplate. Then each turn you can either attempt to turn up the heat, season your dish, or attempt to steal another cook's recipe in the making. Heating your hotplate is a random affair with a die, and could raise the heat on everyone's plate. Spicing the dish is heart of the game and done by up-ending small bottles filled with little colored wood pellets. When the pellets tumble out of the bottle (sometimes, if they do), the number of pellets can't exceed two, because over-spicing the dish ruins it and you have to throw it in the trash!&#10;&#10;The 2009 version includes some changed rules, a new victory condition, additional recipes and some new mechanics in comparison to the 1989 version.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,30,"['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Set Collection']",8,30,1.2944,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Action / Dexterity'],False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,884,7,37,106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21685627155549542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17313283132685747,0.0,0.4780251075200907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22941693947872546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2158331433136656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18005180794660458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2038947094015919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16646801178154472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19115057754760517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24051570907972605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23334570242421035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15032348097091391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2347137307241243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17263180218239568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21789689001362403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40449869429721147,0.0,0.1616995845249867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

If the sixty-second sand timer runs out, then no one gets treasure. When all of the dragons have been slain and the treasure claimed or discarded, the game ends and players score for their holdings, with silver and magic objects worth 1 point each, gold worth 3, the Black Diamond worth 7, and the colored gems scoring 10-15 points for those players who hold more than everyone else. (In the Advanced game, the colored gems score 8-12 points in addition to a variety bonus of 5 points for each set of different colored gems a player holds.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Pok&eacute;mon is a Collectible Card Games based upon Japanese anime that have found success internationally, and is one of the longest surviving CCGs currently available. Pok&eacute;mon was one of the first Collectible Card Games to offer any competition to the market dominance of Magic:  The Gathering.&#10;&#10;Many people who buy the product often do not play the game, choosing instead to collect their favorite characters from the franchise the game is based upon.&#10;&#10;Each player plays the role of a Pok&eacute;mon trainer that use their Pok&eacute;mon creatures to battle the Pok&eacute;mon creatures of the other Pok&eacute;mon trainer.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to play your Pok&eacute;mon cards, that represent different creatures, and be the first player to &quot;knock out&quot; (defeat) six opposing Pok&eacute;mon.  You play the game with a deck of sixty cards that include your Pok&eacute;mon, as well as Trainer cards and Energy cards.  Trainer cards affect the game, players, or Pok&eacute;mon in different ways, most of them temporary, while Energy cards act as the resources in the game.&#10;&#10;You start the game by drawing seven cards to your hand.  Each player picks a Basic Pok&eacute;mon from their hand and places it in front of them to start.  This is called the Active Pok&eacute;mon and is the one currently dueling.  Players can also place other Basic Pok&eacute;mon to fill up the five slots on their &quot;Bench&quot;.  Six cards are then set aside to act as Prize cards.  Each time you defeat one of your opponent's Pok&eacute;mon, you get to draw one of these Prize cards.&#10;&#10;Players take alternating turns during which they can:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw a card from their deck to their hand&#10;     Play Actions:&#10;         Put Basic Pok&eacute;mon in play from their hand to their Bench&#10;         Evolve their Pok&eacute;mon&#10;         Attach an Energy card to one of their Pok&eacute;mon (once per turn)&#10;         Play Trainer cards (Only 1 Stadium card and 1 Supporter card per turn)&#10;         Retreat their Active Pok&eacute;mon (once per turn - trade places with one on the Bench (usually at the cost of Energy cards))&#10;         Use Abilities&#10;    &#10;     Attack&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to Basic Pok&eacute;mon cards, there are also Evolution cards, which depict evolved forms of Basic Pok&eacute;mon (or sometimes other Evolved Pok&eacute;mon). A player can evolve a Pok&eacute;mon by laying a corresponding Evolution card onto another Pok&eacute;mon card in play.  This can only be done once per turn per Pok&eacute;mon, and only if the Pok&eacute;mon has been in play at least one entire turn.  The Evolved Pok&eacute;mon retains any damage and Energy cards, but loses any Special Conditions affecting it, and the card text completely replaces the previous card.&#10;&#10;The last action a player takes during their turn, if they choose, is to have their Active Pok&eacute;mon use one of its abilities to attack the other player's Active Pok&eacute;mon.  Attacks can only be used if the Pok&eacute;mon has enough Energy cards of the right type attached to it to meet the requirements for the attack; each attack has different requirements and effects that are listed on the card.  Most attacks will do some amount of damage to the Defending Pok&eacute;mon; if defeated, the Defending Pok&eacute;mon is replaced with another Pok&eacute;mon from the Bench, and the attacker draws a Prize card.  If either the attacker draws their last Prize card or the Defender cannot replace the Active Pok&eacute;mon (due to an empty Bench), the attacker has won the game.&#10;&#10;There are many different varieties of Pok&eacute;mon available and several different forms of each one, each with different attacks, abilities and characteristics, allowing for many different possible outcomes.

In each version, the object of the game revolves around using a plastic axe to tap a tree made out of individual flat segments without causing any segments to fall out of the tree.&#10;&#10;Tok Tok Woodman First edition:&#10;A very simple dexterity game with 12 large wooden discs, a wooden axe, and a die. The discs are stacked as a tower. A player turn consists of rolling the die and then hitting the tower with the axe. For example, if you roll a five, you have to hit the fifth disc five times with the axe. The player causing the tower to fall loses.&#10;&#10;Toc Toc Woodman Second edition: &#10;A dexterity game where nine plastic tree segments are stacked up.  Each tree segment has four bark sections around it.  On their turn, a player gets two taps with the axe to try and knock off pieces of bark from the tree segments for one point a piece. But be careful, if a tree segment comes down it's minus 5 points! A quick unique dexterity game.&#10;&#10;Click Clack Lumberjack First edition:&#10;Very similar to Toc Toc Woodman Second edition, but adds some optional grub stickers which you may apply to bark pieces in order to add various rules for the grub.

Those actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Draw contagion cards equal to your current incubation rate.&#10;     Advance one of three mutations to the next level.&#10;     Spread disease equal to your current transmission rate.&#10;&#10;&#10;When the number of diseases equals the city&rsquo;s population number, the city is wiped out.  The player who placed the final disease earns a special action. The player with the most diseases scores the population number. The two smaller numbers are awarded to those with the second- and third-most diseases.&#10;&#10;Your disease card has three mutations: Incubation (number of cards you can draw), Transmission (number of disease cubes you can spread), and Resistance (number of cubes/cards you can protect). As an action, you can advance a mutation one level by discarding the required number of cards.&#10;&#10;Event cards are drawn at the start of each round and affect everyone during their turn. You might benefit from the card or it could have a negative impact. WHO cards are always bad, but your resistance will lessen whatever the penalty would be based on its level, if you planned ahead.&#10;&#10;Mid-game scoring occurs when the second, fourth and sixth skull comes out.  When a city icon appears, a new city is introduced.&#10;&#10;Once the event/WHO deck runs out or only two city cards remain in play, the game ends, with players conducting a final scoring round to see which virus is victorious.&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;",2,5,30,30,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Hand Management', 'Tags']",14,30,1.8952,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Medical']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2253,23,135,178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21083883221047614,0.13364306593723582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09118048444640049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07904436299375338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48630309401546296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08708283206689943,0.09350783087743995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09553693536340252,0.0,0.0,0.12666072615833218,0.09953287212138377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14811540669107204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07107187124456035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09717300448904669,0.0,0.0849086197266005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1978439852235895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0796015342778823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09661583320491778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2967659778353843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06052637264624604,0.0,0.06288947765460881,0.0,0.08824411630830814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07497963305126246,0.43819829967334023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08456371273353093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08105051566924383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07428506157746091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12607117828458778,0.0,0.1651747327577159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09501423080509265,0.1749280927249004,0.17194484725450043,0.0,0.17341453119738803,0.08046094786577321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09661583320491778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07209833830640353,0.0,0.06804136904755956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18237966026547098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08904895447590659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08456371273353093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

635,2760,1293,Boggle,1972,6.02987,"Boggle is a timed word game in which players have 3 minutes to find as many connected words as possible from the face up letters resting in a 16 cube grid.  When the timer runs out, players compare their lists of words and remove any words found by multiple players.  Points are then awarded for remaining words, depending on how many letters are in the word.

636,2764,18866,Shear Panic,2005,6.0292,"The second game from Fragor Games, featuring a flock of sheep and their attempts to be in the right place at the right time. Much gambolling, some tupping, lots of shearing.&#10;&#10;Publisher Blurb:&#10;&#10;&quot;'The Best Game Ewe Ever Herd!'&#10;&#10;Ah, do ewe long for the life of a sheep? Bright summer days filled with games of tag and attempts to flock closer to Roger, the Heartthrob Ram? But, Watch Out! The shearer wants to drag you away from all the fun and games!&#10;&#10;In Shear Panic, ewe maneuver your ewes to score points, playing tag, standing close to Roger, or trying to avoid the shearing scissors! Will your brave sheep score the most points, or will it be &quot;Off with the wool&quot; for ewe?&quot;&#10;&#10;The game includes eleven small figurines (which are somewhat fragile): Two each of four different colors, one black, one 'Roger', and one 'Shearer'. Also included are four player mats in different colors; a timing/scoring mat; 48 mutton buttons in four colors; four scoring markers; one flock marker; and two special six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;There are two separate play areas: The one where the flock of sheep figurines are clustered; and the combination timing/scoring mat. (The timing mat is two-sided for 3 or 4 players.) Actions by the players each turn cause the timing marker to move faster or slower through each of the four fields, and the scoring is different in each field.&#10;&#10;Field 1 is Team Tag. Players score higher for keeping their sheep closer together. Field 2 is Roger&rsquo;s Field, where players score more the closer they are to Roger (the ram). Field 3 is Black Sheep Tag, and players score higher the closer they are to the black sheep. Field 4 is the Shear Panic Field, and the row of sheep closest to the shearer figure are eliminated each turn, while the remainder are scored individually. The timing marker indicates which Field the sheep are currently &ldquo;in&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Players have a total of twelve actions they may take during the course of the game, and as each one is used, a &ldquo;mutton button&rdquo; is placed over it, eliminating it from future use. Also, the more powerful the action, the farther (faster) the timing marker will move. If the timing marker lands on a red spot, the active player executes a free &ldquo;lamb slam&rdquo; by rolling the Panic Die and moving a sheep of the color rolled one space in any direction. If the Panic Die rolls white, the entire flock does a &ldquo;ewe turn&rdquo; ninety degrees in a direction of the active player&rsquo;s choice.&#10;&#10;Since all the player mats are visible to everyone, players need to keep an eye on what moves are still available to their opponents.&#10;&#10;The game is intended for three or four players, but rules for a two-player variant are included.&#10;&#10;Starting player is the person who most recently was sheared (had their hair cut).&#10;&#10;",2,4,45,45,"['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Pattern Building']",10,45,2.2219,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Animals'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2909,27,185,222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0678774275172121,0.12907509626514596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07715428900511602,0.09440181578401602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07430109938219898,0.0,0.28839240466050764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08374357902934601,0.2738159106294178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08234412436056261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07087919716981719,0.17361609457036853,0.16366653806562537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09385159507405855,0.0,0.08200641154176078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3814257430113311,0.0,0.0,0.09440181578401602,0.0,0.0,0.2008602036231567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877031901481171,0.07688072424645159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0794603491107042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09127197020980593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08721954926042305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060739891930836634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14133442993913864,0.0922714473992953,0.0880639015940344,0.0,0.0,0.07430109938219898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08038437542019738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06046007412880211,0.07828017891523499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0671354376684541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08374357902934601,0.0,0.07405747755939267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15952899899262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15952899899262,0.06943247648021046,0.0,0.3285784488044694,0.0,0.33789797098113333,0.08303385422964467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09554080213262996,0.0,0.07555695369104912,0.08763808579717627,0.0,0.08200641154176078,0.0,0.06963399030239711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09613080155350255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08167329359792458,0.0,0.058715285227557645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056965698875297045,0.0,0.08374357902934601,0.0,0.0,0.09278691467377592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08167329359792458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055332841188393926,0.07264455916127215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Each player has a 4x4 grid, and to complete set up, each player takes four tiles at random, then places them in order from low to high down the diagonal that goes from upper left to lower right.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you take either a face-down tile from the pile or a face-up tile from the table. You can (1) place this tile in an empty space in your grid, (2) swap this tile for a tile already in the grid, or (3) discard this tile face-up on the table. However, all tiles in your grid must obey one rule at all times: A tile must be higher in value that any tile directly above it or to its immediate left and lower in value that any tile directly below it or to its immediate right. Whoever first fills their grid with sixteen tiles wins. (If the draw pile runs out, then whoever has the most tiles in their grid wins.)&#10;&#10;You can play Lucky Numbers tournament style by playing multiple games and having each player start once. The winner of a game receives 2 points, while each loser receives -1 point for each empty space in their grid.

Creeper cards usually prevent you from winning, but are sometimes necessary to meet the Goal.&#10;&#10;",2,6,10,40,"['Hand Management', 'Set Collection']",8,40,1.4227,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Science Fiction']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,913,10,44,108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12402189766009573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17674954159660894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16859330744970355,0.1504546494748383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13068906911929043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13575887715065493,0.1714804662648727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17674954159660894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14518557414310207,0.0,0.0,0.17248579924634888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16250337541838908,0.0,0.0,0.3086942825429673,0.561888902587514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13852690024969727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13273213808194875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11098058568912746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13400432148805552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1536744152866115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11673434003022017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13531374477188016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12686319749127326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1601274842819869,0.0,0.29967519841923673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1536744152866115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12233356767201328,0.0,0.15861088362174372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
645,2969,1917,Stratego,1946,5.99416,"Stratego by Jumbo is the most well-known of this type of hidden tactics board games. It was launched just after World War II in 1946 and has led to a variety of various themed versions and spinoff variations.&#10;&#10;This game is very similar to, and almost certainly derived directly from, the Gibsons game L'Attaque who had acquired the UK rights in 1925 from the game&rsquo;s creator Mademoiselle Hermance Edan who launched it in France in 1909. It is not exactly the same, but not far from it (numbered pieces, spy (same name) can kill the strongest piece but only when attacking, flag, bombs, etc.) The game in turn likely drew on various ancient Chinese board games such as Lu Zhan Jun Qi or the classic children's game Jungle.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;&#10;The gameboard is your battlefield.  You have an army of men at your disposal and six bombs.  Your mission--protect your flag and capture your opponent's flag.&#10;&#10;Secretly place your men, bombs, and flag on the gameboard with these objectives in mind.  But remember your opponent is doing the same thing, so you must plan a defense as well as an offense.&#10;&#10;Once the armies are in place, advance your men.  When you're one space away from an enemy, attack.  You and your opponent declare ranks.  The lower-ranking man is captured and out of play.&#10;&#10;You control your pieces and risk your men in battles where the strength of your enemy is unknown. The suspense builds as your men move deeper into enemy territory. Move with caution and courage. The next piece you attack could be a bomb.  And when attacked, it could &quot;blast&quot; your man off the board and out of play.&#10;&#10;The first to capture an enemy flag is the winner!&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;     Stratego (Revised Edition) (aka Stratego Fire &amp; Ice)&#10;     The Generals&#10;     Stratego Legends&#10;     Stratego: Star Wars&#10;     Stratego: Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition&#10;     Ultimate Stratego&#10;     Electronic Stratego&#10;     Stratego: Marvel Heroes&#10;     Stratego: Star Wars Saga Edition&#10;     Stratego: The Chronicles of Narnia &#226;&#128;&#147; The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe&#10;&#10;&#10;and numerous others.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    L'Attaque&#10;    Dover Patrol&#10;    Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence&#10;    Battle of Britain (Gibsons English fifth edition)&#10;    Tri-Tactics&#10;    Sharpe's Attack&#10;    Jeu de la Quille&#10;    Admirals&#10;    Attack&#10;    Batalj&#10;    Game of the Generals&#10;    Lu Zhan Jun Qi (Land Army Chess)&#10;    Hai Lu Kong Zhan Qi (Sea-Land-Air Fighting Chess)&#10;    Si Guo Da Zhan (The Great Battle of Four Countries)&#10;    Jungle (&#233;&#172;&#165;&#231;&#141;&#184;&#230;&#163;&#139; (d&ograve;u sh&ograve;u q&iacute;) or &ldquo;Animal Chess&rdquo;)&#10;    Dong Wu Qi (&#229;&#139;&#149;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#230;&#163;&#139; or &ldquo;Animal Game&quot;)&#10;&#10;&#10;Different Edition Complications&#10;When first produced in Europe, the most powerful pieces had higher numbers.  I.e. the Marshall (most powerful piece) was a 10, the General was a 9, and so on.  The higher the rank, the higher the number.&#10;When they introduced Stratego in the USA, the numbering was reversed, so the Marshall was a 1, the General 2, and so on.  The 1st rank (most powerful) was 1, the second most powerful was 2, 3rd most powerful was 3....&#10;Then, in 2000s Hasbro re-imagined Stratego in the USA and made a few changes.  They reduced the number of pieces per side (from 40 to 30), added additional powers, and changed the numbering to reflect the European system.&#10;This caused extreme consternation with many faithful American Stratego fans who preferred the 'old way'.  (Actually the second oldest way, but whatever.)  Many of these insist on playing Stratego with the 'Marshall 1 system'.&#10;This wouldn't be a problem, except any and all discussions of Stratego are fraught with misunderstandings by those who are unaware of dual numbering systems!

Throw things at your friends.&#10;&#10;Throw Throw Burrito is what you get when you cross a card game with dodgeball. Try to collect matching sets of cards faster than your opponents while simultaneously ducking, dodging, and throwing squishy airborne burritos. The cards you collect earn points, but getting hit by flying burritos loses them. So clear some space and put away the antiques, because you&rsquo;ve never played a card game quite like this before.&#10;&#10;How it works: Place a pair of burritos on a table and draw cards. Keep your cards a secret. Rack up points by finding sets of three in the deck. Find matches before anyone else does. If someone plays Burrito Cards, a Battle ensues. Steal points from your opponents by hitting them with squishy toy burritos. Declare war on your friends. Some battles only involve a handful of players. Others force the entire table to engage in a Burrito War. Duel to determine the winner.

During the game, players travel backwards and forwards through history, doing all those things people have always dreamed of using a time machine to do: Visiting the great moments of the past, peeking into the future, collecting up impossible artifacts and priceless works of art (at the moment just before history records their destruction), coming to grips with the paradoxes of time travel, and of course, changing pivotal events and altering the course of history itself. How would the timeline be different if Lincoln and JFK had not been assassinated? And is that the version of reality that you came from originally...the one you must return to in order to win?

Can you remember the numbers on the other players' cards? Can you keep a poker face, but notice when another player looks pleased? Sharpen your memory and your timing, and have fun with the cool cats and bad rats of Rat-a-Tat Cat.  This is the Gamewright version.&#10;&#10;1996 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;Republished 2002 by Amigo as Biberbande:&#10;&#10;Biberbande is a card game for Ages 6 and up, the object of which is to improve your initial unknown 4-card hand so that you have a lower sum of cards than the other players. There are 66 cards in the deck, which consists of ranks 0-9 (four of ranks 0-8 and nine 9's) and 3 different types of action cards (9 &quot;Exchange&quot;, 7 &quot;Spy&quot;, and 5 &quot;2 X draw&quot;). Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards. The 'Exchange' card allows a player to exchange one of his cards with one of his opponents. The 'Spy' card allows a player to look at one of his own cards. Finally the &quot;2X look&quot; card allows a player to look at the top card of the draw pile, then keep it or throw it away. If she throws it away, she must use the next card in the draw pile.&#10;&#10;",2,6,10,10,"['Memory', 'Open Drafting', 'Push Your Luck', 'Take That']",6,10,1.1176,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Animals', 'Card Game', ""Children's Game"", 'Memory']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2269,23,102,177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3254168461284059,0.06188097026758,0.07863075777131033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26396758037000767,0.0,0.0,0.0844389015986975,0.0,0.06676762610603064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1810318527668976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08659417174745553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08659417174745553,0.0,0.0,0.1641786931053132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058647925910011924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05230982825187855,0.26254474665884425,0.34291061093754194,0.09275342413909259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05179157414216991,0.06581705261702675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41149273312505036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18286250210566207,0.0,0.0,0.0905159263834488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05906344043445265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1619944892607861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058924116834044096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15237899929728796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05605125323727343,0.0,0.2911981904632573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06943588746606986,0.0579713385121891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07707548999439978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0750579091421919,0.0,0.08362930558578056,0.0,0.06125905422222491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06879267030523029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11674989316230155,0.07195768068577918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06301061570938332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08135566316131103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24739490967098507,0.08896749991731515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08403061378133704,0.0,0.053055159352599655,0.0,0.0,0.07961590753699374,0.0,0.0,0.07799623379989236,0.0,0.0,0.07424363244781895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05393698913870526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
661,3424,943,Ligretto,1988,5.92377,"In Ligretto, each player has their own deck of forty cards, with cards 1-10 in four colors and a unique symbol on the back to identify which cards are theirs. At the start of each round, each player lays out 3-5 cards (depending on the number of players) face up in front of them to create their row; places a face-up stack of ten cards, seeing only the top card, next to their row to create their Ligretto stack; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.&#10;&#10;Playing at the same time, each player tries to empty their Ligretto stack. If a player has a 1 card on top of any face-up stack, they play it to the center of the table. If they have a 2 card of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, they can place the 2 card on the 1. All cards in the central piles must be played in ascending order and must be the same color.&#10;&#10;If a player can't play anything, they can reveal cards from the stack in their hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card. They can play this top card onto a central pile as long as the rules for doing so are met.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player empties their Ligretto stack, the round ends. Each player scores 1 point for each of their cards among the central piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in their Ligretto stack. In some versions of the game, the player with the highest score wins; in other versions, players then sort all the cards and play another round, with the first player to reach 99 points winning.&#10;&#10;A rules variant for Ligretto allows a player to play cards from their Ligretto stack or the cards in hand onto the cards in their row, but only if the numbers are in descending order and the colors of adjacent cards are not identical.&#10;&#10;",2,4,10,10,"['Ordering', 'Pattern Building', 'Real-Time', 'Speed Matching']",8,10,1.1694,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Real-time']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1799,12,69,132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11026716883533833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08367251490029874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09141555177346847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20125331992919232,0.21934561711011732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20668853527736714,0.07349698859720064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08248126580157839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4297321153455007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07638714710751078,0.11343364502739728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22152932482370422,0.0,0.0,0.10334426763868357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1048034013762222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08701635309594201,0.07264909610158035,0.0,0.2255449947116025,0.0,0.0,0.14945330630567066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07264909610158035,0.0,0.10795854699496947,0.0,0.0,0.07676922823416595,0.08067024285492408,0.0,0.09304137056448882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11026716883533833,0.0,0.116237654623323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2194646809754246,0.0,0.0,0.1668607499764396,0.0,0.07896426740480098,0.11026716883533833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07896426740480098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18476044578578557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11551120207865226,0.07055254993636327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06845023913249935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41337707055473427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0834303749882198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.232475309246646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10430893875810789,0.06759329020053233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
662,3460,437,Master Labyrinth,1991,5.91848,"This earlier Master Labyrinth is very different than the 2007 dragon-themed Master Labyrinth.&#10;&#10;Part of the Ravensburger Labyrinth Games series, this game is based on the simpler, original Labyrinth game. It is played on a board with maze tiles (straight, L, and T shaped corridors) randomly arranged on it.  Players are represented on the board by little wizard pawns.  Players are wizards-in-training, and they are charged with exploring the maze and finding all the ingredients (numbered chips) needed to become a Wizard.  The trick is that chips must be claimed in numerical order.  Perhaps the most novel aspect of this game is that players mutate the maze by sliding a tile onto the board from the side, which hopefully will enable them to travel to the next ingredient.  Once all twenty-one items have been claimed, the highest total score wins, but each player also holds a secret recipe worth bonus points if they were able to capture three specific ingredients.&#10;&#10;",2,4,20,30,"['Map Deformation', 'Modular Board', 'Point to Point Movement']",10,30,1.7789,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"[""Children's Game"", 'Fantasy', 'Maze', 'Puzzle']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,988,8,36,110,0.0,0.22149544731684265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.187235297566937,0.0,0.19198734539088927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21391174574129107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13380102348582723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16420766969222406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21093354235315448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23290720959516215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23724992981944912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1776070218558446,0.0,0.0,0.23017727921240622,0.0,0.0,0.15252280574315036,0.20627631569762978,0.0,0.20030918483433027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1566918574696931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16117210004574736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21493823443554094,0.0,0.19059081439313258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20451006700230245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23724992981944912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14400314231414973,0.0,0.1971480272744343,0.1781656131057934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22756607971628204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.137963067203218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2226614669898752

Your death ray had wonderful pest control applications, and your volcano activator was perfect for fighting global warming. But the fools at the institute, they wouldn't listen. They called you mad! You built a monster to rend them limb from limb, which your minions assured you was the very worst way to be rended. When it became clear that the only hope for the world was your own benign leadership, you took control of TV to announce this fact. But your broadcast was interrupted by someone else taking control of TV and announcing his own plan for world domination &ndash; and then that broadcast was interrupted by yet another interloper. So. Competition. Well, the world will never be as scared of these upstarts as it will be of you. Archimedes once said, &quot;Give me a long enough lever and a place to stand, and I will move the world.&quot; You will be the most terrifying lever the world has ever seen.&#10;&#10;Nefarious is a quick-playing game in which the players race to build inventions like a freeze ray, cloaking device, or robotic pet before their opponents can do the same. (Interesting side note: Eighteen different artists contributed to the artwork on the different inventions in the game.)&#10;&#10;Nefarious is played over several rounds. In each round the players simultaneously choose and reveal one of their actions that will allow them to allocate one of their Minions to an area on their Lair, obtain money, obtain a blueprint for an invention, or build one of their inventions if they have enough money to do so. The minions that you allocate to your Lair can earn you additional income depending on the actions that your neighbors choose. The first player to build 20 or more points worth of Inventions AND have more points than any other player wins.&#10;&#10;There is a twist to the game, though &ndash; actually, two twists! At the beginning of the game, you randomly draw two Twist cards, which change the environment so that the game plays differently each time. This means that in order to win, the players will have to revise their strategies each time they play Nefarious.&#10;&#10;",2,6,30,45,"['Hand Management', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']",8,45,1.7342,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Humor', 'Science Fiction']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2176,21,75,201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16779363173069067,0.0,0.0,0.11338271558021766,0.0,0.10329599544504772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09052203300888774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12420008686544881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.254288825975036,0.0,0.0,0.12200416995115439,0.0,0.1227194398509928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12575298855575057,0.0,0.0,0.17846653406801483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3159718598500306,0.0,0.11995002686165644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14184095723834944,0.0,0.0929820856386036,0.0,0.11180413565452474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12345115416919804,0.0,0.0,0.2042769596920399,0.0,0.0,0.12200416995115439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11448034749075987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09443567938237776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11338271558021766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21962845407796053,0.0,0.09186519310959707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19068161370362358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10449720105922813,0.08084385381991803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07859622581213503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12420008686544881,0.08305363619774735,0.08727399188669965,0.11338271558021766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11504369265803246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12575298855575057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07914342847713891,0.09755859128399902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11030016275332227,0.10839940873680314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12420008686544881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11030016275332227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14810729218792115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09413960123763136,0.0,0.09384625196252622,0.0,0.0,0.08703735011971298,0.0,0.0,0.07312654644123849,0.0,0.0,0.44490829814272714,0.11802045602918876

668,3609,214,Café International,1989,5.89539,"This game revolves around the placement of multi-national customers in a restaurant. The board shows many different tables, each with four chairs around them. The tables are grouped by nation, so the Chinese like to sit with other Chinese.

671,3679,34127,Ticket to Ride: The Card Game,2008,5.88641,"A New Train Adventure Begins!&#10;&#10;The Ticket to Ride Card Game delivers all of the excitement, fun, and nail-biting tension of the original Ticket to Ride board game, but with several unique game-play twists in a new stand-alone, card game format.&#10;&#10;Players collect sets of illustrated Train cards, which are then used to complete Destination Tickets - routes between two cities depicted on each ticket. But before their Train cards can be used, players must face the risk of &quot;train robbing,&quot; where another player may force them to lose their hard-earned cards.&#10;&#10;Contains 96 illustrated train car cards, 46 destination tickets, 6 big city prize cards, and a rulebook.&#10;&#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10;To begin the game, each player is dealt train car cards and destination ticket cards.  All these cards are kept secret from the other players until played or scored.  Each player may keep all his ticket cards, just one or any number in between.  A player's turn has two parts: first the player moves face up train car cards from his Railyard to his face down, On-the-Track stack; second the player may perform one of the following actions: 1) draw more train car cards, 2) place train car cards in his Railyard, or 3) draw destination tickets.  Like the original Ticket to Ride board game, when a player chooses to draw train car cards, he may choose from the five face up cards or draw from the top of the face down deck.  When placing cards in the Railyard, a player may place two or more cards of the same color including locomotives which are wild, or three cards, each of a different color.  Also when placing cards in the Railyard, a player may not play cards of the same color as those currently present in his Railyard nor of the same color as those present in any opponent's Railyard unless he plays more of that color than are present in the opponent's Railyard.  If the player plays more, then the opponent must discard his cards of that color.  This is called &quot;Train robbing.&quot;  When drawing destination tickets, a player draws four and may keep any number of them including none.&#10;&#10;When the train car card deck is exhausted in a two or three player game, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  In a four player game, completed tickets are scored and discarded train car cards are reshuffled into a new draw deck.  When that deck is exhausted, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  At the end of the game all tickets not previously scored are scored.  The point values of completed tickets are added to a players score while those of tickets not completed are subtracted.  To complete tickets, players match train car cards in their On-the-Track stack by color and quantity with their tickets.  Each big city bonus is awarded to the player with the most completed tickets having that city.  These bonus points are added to the player's score.

Each player starts the game with six dice of a single color, and three target cards are laid face-up on the table.  Players take turns doing the following: On a turn, a player rolls all of her dice not already on cards, then places any dice that match the targets on the corresponding cards. (Alternatively, before taking her turn, a player can first choose to reclaim all of her dice from all cards.)&#10;&#10;If the player now fulfills the target with her dice &ndash; e.g., a pair of 3s, a quartet of 6s, or a specific combination of numbers &ndash; she claims the card, takes back her dice (and returns any other dice on the card to their owner), then places a new card on the table. Each card is worth a certain number of points.

680,4041,170,Family Business,1982,5.83932,"Family Business takes mob warfare to a new level of backstabbing, revenge, and general bloodthirstiness, which is what makes it such a blast to play.  Every player controls a 'family' and plays various cards to off other players' family members.  In a game with this little structure, it's possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread.  Either way, the last family standing is victorious.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.&#10;&#10;Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.&#10;&#10;In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her.

681,4045,86955,Munchkin Zombies,2011,5.83888,"In a reversal of roles, all players in Munchkin Zombies start out as zombies, and the &quot;monsters&quot; are the normal people trying to stop the zombie invasion (such as the Action Hero, Soccer Mom, Fireman, etc.). Unlike most Munchkin games, there are no classes or races; instead, you can have a mojo: Atomic Zombie, Plague Zombie, and Voodoo Zombie. As with Munchkin Bites! and Super Munchkin, Munchkin Zombies includes powers &ndash; special abilities that you can play as you gain levels.&#10;&#10;Guest artist is Alex Fernandez, who drew the Meals on Wheels card.&#10;&#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;Note: The 2012 edition of Munchkin Zombies from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Munchkin Zombies 2: Armed and Dangerous.&#10;&#10;",3,6,90,90,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Variable Player Powers']",10,90,1.9375,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,"['Card Game', 'Fighting', 'Humor', 'Zombies']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1773,18,92,163,0.11579746647455394,0.0,0.12245030594010786,0.0934535622577163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277489148357648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12997230878226654,0.0,0.10510839802201126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12008377269206329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08421287435676496,0.0,0.0,0.12997230878226654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26637028784854927,0.0,0.10097556509987497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12921476555686282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12008377269206329,0.0,0.0,0.1315404638455074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077760581298552,0.0,0.1843627278463015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10438343986909406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21169858118038412,0.0,0.0,0.12008377269206329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2630809276910148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3749868278149299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10097556509987497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11244769442847441,0.11841189676279919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09243199150788321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2436858310917559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12634415929199333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10297868432532259,0.1315404638455074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12703922009939203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10699208663585948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09587199583142897,0.0,0.09047728426097411,0.11579746647455394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39705832305973965,0.10438343986909406,0.11244769442847441,0.0,0.0,0.12066001330290078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10367374513272128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10738179334459665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

683,4076,91534,Struggle for Catan,2011,5.83525,"In 2010, designer Klaus Teuber overhauled the two-player Catan card game with the release of The Rivals for Catan &ndash; released in Germany as Die F&uuml;rsten von Catan &ndash; and in 2011 Teuber, Kosmos and Mayfair Games present a new multi-player card game set in the Catan universe: The Struggle for Catan, aka, Die Siedler von Catan: Das schnelle Kartenspiel.&#10;&#10;As in the original The Settlers of Catan board game, players need to manage their resources in order to build settlements, roads, cities, city improvements and knights, all of which grant victory points (VPs) or special abilities. Control of roads and knights can change hands during the game, so don't assume that what's yours will stay yours. City improvements are expensive, but they bring you additional VPs and other bonuses, so strive to spiff up your cities!

Star Munchkin is a complete game using the best-selling Munchkin rules (with a few new twists like Sidekicks), and it can be combined with any other Munchkin items.&#10;&#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;Note: The 2012 edition of Star Munchkin from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Star Munchkin 2: The Clown Wars.

686,4134,2448,Kalah,700,5.82865,"The most common rule set in games sold commercially as Mancala is for this game of Kalah. Mancala is actually a whole family of games. Kalah was invented in 1940 by an American, William Champion Jr..  He started selling the game in 1944, patented the rules in the 1950's, and founded the Kalah Game Co. in 1958.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board of two rows, each consisting of six round pits. The rows have a large store at either end called the Kalah. A player owns the six pits closest to them and the Kalah on their right side.&#10;&#10;The game is started with four (4) seeds in each pit. A player takes all the seeds from one of their pits, and then they are distributed one by one, counterclockwise, in the pits and the player's own Kalah, but not into the opponent's store (Kalah). If the last seed is dropped into an opponent's pit or a non-empty pit of the player, the move ends without anything being captured. If the last seed falls into the player's Kalah, they must move again. If the last seed is put into an empty pit owned by the player, they capture all contents of the opposite pit together with the capturing piece and puts them in their Kalah. If the opposite pit is empty, nothing is captured. A capture ends the move.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player no longer has any seeds in any of their holes.

687,4195,859,Illuminati,1982,5.82312,"Illuminati is a classic Steve Jackson (I) game of world domination. Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.&#10;&#10;The game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player's turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.&#10;&#10;How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending &quot;megabucks&quot;. Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.&#10;&#10;The winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.&#10;&#10;This first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 1&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 2&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 3&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-published as:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati&#10;&#10;&#10;CCG Version:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati: New World Order&#10;&#10;&#10;Magazine Articles:&#10;&#10;    Imagine (Issue 6 - Sep 1983)&#10;        European Illuminati - New cards.&#10;    &#10;    The Space Gamer (Issue 59 - Jan 1983)&#10;        Illuminating the Post Office - Converting six groups to Illuminati.&#10;    &#10;    Space Gamer (Issue 72 - Jan 1985)&#10;        Death to Deadheads! - Variant rules for Illuminati, The Evil Geniuses Are Here! - Variant new cards for Illuminati, More Groups Illuminated! - A couple more illuminated groups for Illuminati, The Monty Python Illuminati - The British Illuminati, 24 groups, and 3 special cards with a Monty Python theme.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",2,6,60,120,['Hand Management'],12,120,2.4842,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Novel-based', 'Political', 'Science Fiction']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2610,21,194,173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05805650473236802,0.272194208166844,0.0,0.0,0.09979482679739443,0.0,0.06888415161378622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06888415161378622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06134778633678066,0.06648803291842466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043829322304506965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07818535051564701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05255361037663741,0.0,0.051891483697470674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18749592922921507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05125343976009625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8215365306085343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04352419679388698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06053162640618558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04456262260924074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06249864307640502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05359615118547569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049753015261414936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06279855251009024,0.0,0.0,0.13027096878874556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054141612983777496,0.06279855251009024,0.06846137755071119,0.11752616215940366,0.0,0.2494870669934861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05509018316281068,0.049609795897582944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04207343062057739,0.06725094766508342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05828888262815068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05172978416903993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062203774376741204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1471449935824498,0.0

692,4329,5576,Dungeoneer: Tomb of the Lich Lord,2003,5.80899,"'Dungeoneer - Perilous Adventures in an Ever-Changing Labyrinth.&#10;&#10;In Dungeoneer', you take up the mantle of a great Hero set out to prove your valor in the Tomb of the Lich Lord. To triumph over your rivals, you will need to explore the labyrinth of corridors, defeat the heinous monsters, overcome nefarious traps and be the first to complete all your Quests. But beware, the gods are fickle and to test their Heroes even further, they often bestow upon them Banes as well as Boons.&#10;&#10;Game Description:&#10;&#10;This simple card game is very reminiscent of Wiz-War. Players are dealt one of 4 Heroes, each with varying movement, fighting and magic abilities. The Dwarf for example is very tough, but has no magic value at all. Each Hero also has a value for hit points, the amount of Treasure he can have (carry) at any time and also the number of &quot;Boons&quot; (special abilities) he may have.

This  simple mechanic balances the game by spreading the attacks around as you can't attack someone that can't pay the Peril price.&#10;&#10;Players attempt various quests (some are simple die rolls in a certain room, some are tough combat and some a series of things to do), with each completed quest having your Hero &quot;go up a level&quot; which increases his abilities.&#10;&#10;Treasures &amp; Boons help you, Banes, Traps &amp; Encounters hurt you (which are played on you by other players).&#10;&#10;The dungeon map is different each time as it is made up of cards played one at time onto the table by each player.&#10;&#10;This game was introduced at DunDraCon 2003, in San Ramon, Ca.

Each player takes on one of four factions: Humans, Orcs, Night Elves and Undead. It can be played cooperatively, with humans and night elves in one alliance and orcs and undead in the second.&#10;&#10;The game is set up with a modular board, depicting resources, victory point locations and the players' town halls. Throughout the game, players need to harvest resources, build units and buildings, and use their army to defeat their opponents.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players move their existing units, harvest gold and lumber with their workers, deploy units onto the board that were built on a previous turn, and finally spend resources on further units, buildings and outposts. Players also have access to a unique deck of Experience Cards, which are drawn during events like battles and can be used later for special effects.&#10;&#10;A player can win by eliminating all opponents, or by accumulating 15 total victory points.&#10;&#10;",2,4,120,120,"['Dice Rolling', 'Modular Board', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers']",12,120,2.7638,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,"['City Building', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Video Game Theme', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1554,11,84,142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11032743328665823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12408665320495557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21196352886759068,0.0,0.2687961618674419,0.15254563959062864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14679191965850216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09941825707886888,0.1562502437573616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1562502437573616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14603388225644698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10332773047717951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10882552823891792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2999545601408575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14529001461076185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11807589131853319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11486193172438776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12076841867845158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15254563959062864,0.0,0.26131225477608594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10384456579791582,0.0,0.0,0.12585564489512935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3722599596148667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.129648585969044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349625692684396,0.0,0.0,0.12631045853518008,0.19699616579319135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11318253653062225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14679191965850216,0.12496132050937712,0.11253013240565088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15254563959062864,0.0,0.0,0.09259159594253186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1508151164973071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11285499755946723,0.08993756198591603,0.11807589131853319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21141650595356137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10882552823891792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Another player will draw 3 demonic tracks, and choose to add one to the opposing teams track, attempting to sabotage them, and spare their own tracks.

Several character classes each have slightly different fighting abilities &ndash; most notably the wizard, who can cast spells. Combat is simulated using dice; players roll the dice to attack a monster, and if unsuccessful, the dice are rolled to determine the effect of the monster's counter-attack.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to bring a certain amount of treasure back to the Dungeon's entrance.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Classic Dungeon&#10;    The New Dungeon&#10;&#10;&#10;",1,8,30,30,"['Area Movement', 'Critical Hits and Failures', 'Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Grid Movement', 'Role Playing', 'Simulation', 'Variable Player Powers']",8,30,1.5566,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,878,7,59,84,0.1554461244608617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17148970802106497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14060794858243186,0.0,0.0,0.14467821322874994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15346400370967275,0.0,0.16120004732333415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17246288937552964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17447438447950359,0.3929989332058735,0.0,0.10083004672362184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17878728342765604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10804184742527573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3355873600252004,0.0,0.0,0.16276058779034935,0.0,0.13554925455532485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15034199425090358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15681747755483486,0.0,0.17246288937552964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5330097400544451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1391712822384245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17053701622496542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14414895352432192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

704,5411,1275,221B Baker Street: The Master Detective Game,1975,5.72333,"221B Baker Street is the London address of the world's most celebrated fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes, and his dedicated companion, Dr. Watson. In this game you start at 221B and travel through the streets and alleys of London picking up clues and attempting to solve the most intriguing cases Holmes and Watson have ever faced.&#10;&#10;Each player assumes the role of Holmes and matches wits with the other players to determine who possesses the most skillful powers of deduction.  Each case is represented by a card that features a crime told in story form, a selection of probable suspects and a list of locations involved in that crime. Clues are hidden throughout London, one in each of fourteen locations. Players must collect clues from each location, noting them down on their checklists as they attempt to find the answers to the questions listed on the case card.&#10;&#10;Naturally, the crime scene will often contain vital clues, and a prudent detective always checks with the neighbors.

708,6190,130592,Clue,2012,5.67923,"Refresh of classic Clue/Cluedo game. Significant change: Adds a new character, Dr. Orchid. Also includes two-player rules.&#10;&#10;Clue/do is a murder mystery game. The aim is to find out who committed the murder, which weapon they used, and where in the mansion they did it. How do you solve the case? By careful questioning of your fellow players you can deduce which information is concealed in the crime envelope. The trick is to be clever with your questioning... Everyone develops their own system! &#10; This version of the game plays faster than older versions of Clue, with the help of bigger spaces on the board, special Red Cards, and a new layout of the mansion so you can walk between rooms. The bedroom has an ensuite, and you can wander from the kitchen straight into the dining room.&#10;&#10;All new artwork brings this classic murder mystery to life, with a high level of detail.&#10;&#10;It also comes with cool red dice!&#10;&#10;Note: In this version of Clue, when playing with the 2-player/Team rules: before you deal the black Clue cards to the players, you take the top four black CLUE cards from the deck and place them face down in a row at the side of the board. When the other player/team cannot answer your question, you get to secretly look at one of the four cards at the side of the board.&#10;&#10;You also don't use the Red Bonus cards in a 2-player/Team game.&#10;&#10;",2,6,40,40,"['Dice Rolling', 'Roll / Spin and Move']",8,40,1.4714,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Bluffing', 'Deduction', 'Murder / Mystery']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1405,19,81,138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3207506897736147,0.14550867222018476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15939104683585648,0.0,0.0,0.161383949033409,0.14550867222018476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1506673152995939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10204295931741658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11824800696250184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13681157674129635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11932771015670841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1325639720830039,0.0,0.21211129036549742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10276592319133702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12648416515091088,0.1491257590483753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12826037510266622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15939104683585648,0.15226933994458824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10086574837194094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1120022801870915,0.14550867222018476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23166887577987072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2782267818164219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1584299109020762,0.11617062408843132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1506673152995939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40876750481016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14348281609382918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09231196812830786,0.12119316640832291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2714151059584337,0.161383949033409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The players endeavor to fulfill their goal by going through any number of different &quot;occupation paths&quot;.  All paths have some prerequisite for entry, and benefits accrue from going through any of the paths more than once.  The different occupations are designed to be suited to different strategies, eg. Hollywood is good for fame points, while &quot;Going to Sea&quot; is good for happiness.  In the end it is the player (or team of players) who gets to their pre-set goal first who will be the winner, and achieve everything they ever wanted in life.&#10;&#10;",2,6,60,60,"['Dice Rolling', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Track Movement', 'Variable Player Powers']",8,60,1.4887,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Economic'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,910,10,42,91,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14267130410330495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34017527908191636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11226834278681787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19506731750994516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18485544283634942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3195878905444922,0.0,0.3715784140032955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18970565581357615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1262457795783086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.351154664656104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.251328375771373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25190830576440143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16975513609307874,0.0,0.12203770407027228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3857088317178865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13517413806241663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16210746726092898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;",3,6,90,90,"['Dice Rolling', 'Trading', 'Variable Player Powers']",10,90,1.8344,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Comic Book / Strip', 'Fighting', 'Humor']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2091,22,198,189,0.0,0.0,0.12503416588268434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1304445822840209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1327148927205291,0.0,0.1073263212619115,0.12380472934274217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12261769572010572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11005027245077927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11576357446006177,0.0,0.08598987500228478,0.0,0.0,0.1327148927205291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27199104568480226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13431613788526503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18825302002424987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10658606555365553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4029484136557951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38289953522669196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10180723684996972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09438242616328214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24882791752998348,0.10411378327652827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12901018458010294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10515166784973758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12971991207015385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10924975814356715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11528880053600744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11824094289364748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4054367675882691,0.10658606555365553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12320609575365922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1058613953397885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10180723684996972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10964768816825546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0962291828094708,0.0
713,7246,74,Apples to Apples,1999,5.63543,"The party game Apples to Apples consists of two decks of cards: Things and Descriptions. Each round, the active player draws a Description card (which features an adjective like &quot;Hairy&quot; or &quot;Smarmy&quot;) from the deck, then the other players each secretly choose the Thing card in hand that best matches that description and plays it face-down on the table. The active player then reveals these cards and chooses the Thing card that, in his opinion, best matches the Description card, which he awards to whoever played that Thing card. This player becomes the new active player for the next round.&#10;&#10;Once a player has won a pre-determined number of Description cards, that player wins.&#10;&#10;Note: &quot;Party Box&quot; editions include all cards from Apples to Apples: Expansion Set #1 and Apples to Apples: Expansion Set #2&#10;&#10;",4,10,20,30,"['Hand Management', 'Player Judge', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']",12,30,1.1539,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Humor', 'Party Game']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,860,5,51,80,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29409314253016827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1717986115635031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1358480597484746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1694344856201235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12105080106680907,0.0,0.5981279452328179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34522599995617304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14155523321315666,0.0,0.0,0.17780957893896027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12162086611314636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14376817347991822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1433174263221077,0.1196543075808531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12644023588444597,0.0,0.17261299997808652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24097472966811873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23986081004657112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15215181189533764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1622958709795131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11132730852903788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
714,7432,27710,Catan Dice Game,2007,5.62931,"Like all the other games of the &quot;Settlers of Catan&quot; series, this game is about building settlements, roads, cities and hiring knights. This time, there is no board on which to place little figures: Every player has his own score card called the building sheet, which depicts a mini Catan (compare with Die Siedler von Catan: Paper &amp; Pencil). You build by drawing the settlements and roads on your score card.&#10;&#10;To build you still require resources. These are collected by a Yahtzee-like mechanism that involves throwing six special dice (depicting the different resource symbols) up to three times. After each roll, the player can select which dice to keep and which to roll again. In the end, he may build using the thusly determined resources, and is awarded victory points for any finished buildings, which are recorded on the score card.&#10;&#10;The game lasts fifteen turns or about 15-30 minutes, after which the player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;Note that the game has been designed for 1-4 players, meaning there is a solitaire version of the game, as well.&#10;&#10;Recent versions include double-sided map sheets and instructions for Catan Dice Game Plus.&#10;&#10;",1,4,15,30,"['Dice Rolling', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Set Collection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game']",7,30,1.2291,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Dice'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1214,10,68,129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14504121954953791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3057728837897491,0.21339394099468414,0.12925270368433162,0.0,0.0,0.1475655757834383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14117204920679888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3323875538166147,0.13569526575190202,0.08527924569231056,0.0,0.0,0.15121330561196603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08443435055443929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11113010837884606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.104659186031774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12420960413835014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22711080525597768,0.0,0.15121330561196603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14191522198371823,0.09494644834273779,0.0,0.0,0.14586430923884502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09450904706259554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23867208975684734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2543101442913665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3081733179717307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12147471270315915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1181079546326913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10884938798827039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1502682651170777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09178165483296126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08904676339777029,0.13972764399841414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11180751005273193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11770719499769942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12715507214568325,0.15121330561196603,0.20332250883454517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11284663801254935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08793196044374219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
715,7474,2944,Halli Galli,1990,5.62799,"Halli Galli is a speed action game in which players watch for sets of exactly five fruit. The deck contains 56 playing cards showing four kinds of fruit in groups of 1 to 5 and a bell of the type found at hotel reception desks.&#10;&#10;The deck is distributed evenly between the players. All players hold their deck face down and take turns dealing one card face up in front of them. As each player reveals her next card, the instant you see a total of five of one kind of fruit on the table, hit the bell. If you're correct, you pick up all the played cards and put them into your deck; if you're wrong, you pay the other players one card each. When you run out of cards, you're out. When two players are left, they play until the bell is struck once more, then the game ends and the taller deck wins.&#10;&#10;Keep in mind that a five-of-a-kind can occur both when cards are revealed and when they're covered. If, for example, cards showing 3, 1 and 4 bananas are on the table and the 3 is then covered by a non-banana card, suddenly five bananas are showing and somebody better be reaching for the bell.&#10;&#10;",2,6,10,10,"['Pattern Recognition', 'Player Elimination']",6,10,1.0158,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Action / Dexterity', 'Card Game', ""Children's Game"", 'Party Game', 'Real-time']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1117,10,48,116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11583618134509688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15412137234605094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15834545102461461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5219115007452078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1171420000723833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16304509593980993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24412660983165832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45827975613681043,0.10848697707335557,0.16110135950115104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13560300892366944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1533254854541418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12358284686349112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10902961844690054,0.11456993903420261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16110135950115104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15746578067073946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14291255225414887,0.0,0.0,0.15102493387963162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2624015034599274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15834545102461461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12206330491582916,0.1533254854541418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0959977169192748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

717,7643,11634,Mexican Train,1994,5.62287,"Mexican Train is a fairly recently developed variation of Domino train type games that has become extremely popular.  Because of its simplicity and interaction,  it can be played by nearly anyone, anywhere.  Depending on the type of game you play, it can last from a single, 20-minute game to a 12 round game lasting hours.&#10;&#10;Although Mexican Train can be played with a standard set of Dominos, branded versions usually include a range of parts to facilitate play and highlight the theme, such as a train station, train pieces to mark players' trains and the &quot;Mexican train&quot;, and a &quot;woo woo!&quot; train whistle.  It is typically played with a set of double 12 dominoes (although double 6 and double 9 sets can be used with fewer players), and there are a variety of sets packaged by various manufactures as &quot;Mexican Train Dominoes&quot; that include all the necessary components to play.&#10;&#10;A double-twelve domino set has 91 tiles. The goal is for the players to get rid of their dominoes. Starting with the highest double tile placed in the middle of the table, which is the station, each player creates a line of dominoes. This is their train. Another train, the &quot;Mexican Train,&quot; can be played on by anyone. In the event that a player cannot play at all, even after drawing a new tile, she must place a marker (often little colored plastic trains that come with the game) on their train which allows others to play on her train temporarily until the marker is removed.&#10;&#10;As soon as one player is out of dominoes, the other players add up the value of their remaining tiles. At the end of the evening, the player with the lowest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;",1,8,20,20,['Tile Placement'],10,20,1.2566,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Abstract Strategy', 'Trains']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1711,14,78,145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12891962984606492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14426332102609418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10946934618542581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12306173993354992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15019660797939507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13222080999739258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15207455003479373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08491525144616834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11680635756913775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10525527868316313,0.0968378926270883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12086170246704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13520604016621898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12397821601657714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14929091496886127,0.15207455003479373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13583191049290536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13912367408711857,0.09504732899063098,0.12306173993354992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4017509086211951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09570906753071674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10330951250975043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2857999404958799,0.27824734817423713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14197610305342606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12086170246704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2527393585390984,0.22840432842577432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2824858693144331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11420216421288716,0.0,0.13053483929761597,0.14929091496886127,0.1175839633499408,0.0,0.15207455003479373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12261155729270787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
718,7790,1515,Upwords,1982,5.61899,"Players take turns forming words on either an 8x8 (original and Winning Moves &quot;new classic&quot; versions) or a 10x10 (most later versions) grid. Words may be formed horizontally or vertically, as in Scrabble, but, as the title suggests, the letters may also be stacked.  This allows already played words to change into different words by stacking new letters (up to a limit of 5 high). For example, LATE could be changed to CATER and then to BELATED. Instead of having different values for each letter, when a new word is formed, the number of tiles used in that word is counted.  If the whole word is one tile high (no stacking), then the word scores 2 points per tile.  However, if there are any stacked tiles, you score one point per tile in the word, including those underneath.  This results in scoring that increases as the game continues, even for simpler words.&#10;&#10;",2,4,90,90,"['Hand Management', 'Layering', 'Spelling', 'Tile Placement']",8,90,1.6856,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,['Word Game'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,885,8,38,101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15388748064263555,0.0,0.1592504776958273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.162219815877411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1547340663268762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18297309854294175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1214389332208289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12459879587900342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16021659170620342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29979627243349527,0.0,0.13752017422920396,0.0,0.0,0.1506655968986043,0.0,0.14626231516517446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14989813621674763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20371481604796302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10138816919051999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1410415841969074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3185009553916546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071381740241906,0.0,0.0,0.12984737218643874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1102015432160245,0.15388748064263555,0.1416590086293338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40440033060568426,0.24364174080643747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11994575226738961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12182087040321873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.324439631754822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14557224932438734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

724,9914,553,Chez Geek,1999,5.57618,"In this light, humorous, and fast-paced card game that parodies geek culture and co-habitation, players are roommates just trying to get through life with as little work as possible.&#10;&#10;At setup each player is dealt a Job card which lists their free time, income, a special ability that they possess and their Slack goal. Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.&#10;&#10;Players take turns as follows:&#10;-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)&#10;&#10;-Make &quot;variable&quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them   the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &quot;uninvited&quot; people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to &quot;get rid of&quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).&#10;&#10;-If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &quot;call&quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &quot;uninvited&quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for &quot;getting rid of&quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &quot;called&quot;) can also be played in this round.&#10;&#10;-For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)&#10;&#10;-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)&#10;&#10;-Additionally, some Life cards are orange &quot;Whenever&quot; cards which can be played at any time.&#10;&#10;-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.&#10;&#10;The first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.&#10;&#10;",2,5,60,60,"['Set Collection', 'Take That', 'Variable Player Powers']",13,60,1.4205,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Card Game'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3299,27,200,220,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049824965311587706,0.0,0.0601962502093927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05111435831071508,0.0,0.0,0.056634582569372094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07056416290325424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06929501262546785,0.1402621556596985,0.0,0.0609504375461252,0.07100794250887833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060444146013602616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2009927121267528,0.05250345671470439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05315706186598439,0.0,0.0792987030563223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10437071413570191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06561441449736594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19712125078168388,0.0,0.06929501262546785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09043274513417232,0.06528464082550711,0.0,0.07056416290325424,0.06200792847784962,0.16930132264092562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18043885018255743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.334987853544588,0.0,0.0,0.07100794250887833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04631930514340888,0.0,0.042910374515709275,0.0,0.3566856457800918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054540218077536055,0.0,0.044380307362704756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06342379108762498,0.0,0.18939466317235967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05746103442189877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3751779034129844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05266464309436978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06929501262546785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29855243280649685,0.08937858390170585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0609504375461252,0.0,0.061471406221859495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06496080934608592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05546206941550846,0.0,0.0,0.0601962502093927,0.0,0.05111435831071508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20907642453688283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34054802709028886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059951727241987995,0.05250345671470439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053324245963330644,0.055273877529839296,0.0609504375461252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05315706186598439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057250831313804124,0.0,0.0,0.0640229185953007,0.060444146013602616,0.0,0.0
725,9973,50381,Cards Against Humanity,2009,5.57533,"&quot;A party game for horrible people.&quot;&#10;&#10;Play begins with a judge, known as the &quot;Card Czar&quot;, choosing a black question or fill-in-the-blank card from the top of the deck and showing it to all players.  Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an &quot;Awesome Point&quot;, and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.&#10;&#10;This, so far, sounds like the popular and fairly inoffensive Apples to Apples. While the games are similar, the sense of humor required is very different. The game encourages players to poke fun at practically every awkward or taboo subject including race, religion, gender, poverty, torture, alcoholism, drugs, sex (oh yes), abortion, child abuse, celebrities, and those everyday little annoyances like &quot;Expecting a burp and vomiting on the floor&quot;.&#10;&#10;In addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are &quot;Pick 2&quot; or cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may bet an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.  If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.&#10;&#10;From the website:&#10;&#10;&quot;Cards Against Humanity is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license - that means you can use and remix the game for free, but you can't sell it.

Can you create a code that can't be cracked? With more than 55 million units sold, mastermind is a great strategy game, and one of the worlds most popular games ever. It&rsquo;s easy to learn and fast to play, and with more than 2,000 possible codes, it&rsquo;s different every time. The codemaker sets a secret code, and then the codebreaker Tries to match the code using logic, deduction, and maybe even a little bit of luck. After each move, the codemaker gives clues to the codebreaker. Make the code even more devious by using multiple pegs of the same color or by leaving one or more peg holes empty. With so many possible code combinations, every game is guaranteed to be a brainteaser. For 2 players, ages 8 and up. Includes game console with built-in storage tray and Code peg shield, 108 Code pegs in 6 colors, 30 key pegs in two colors, and complete instructions.&#10;&#10;This is a two-player game with 4 holes.

728,10344,1294,Clue,1949,5.57007,"For versions of Clue that feature the new character Dr. Orchid, please use this Clue page.&#10;&#10;The classic detective game!  In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where?  Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.  Players must move to a room and then make a suggestion against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards mentioned if in that player's hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more suggestions.  Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file, and then make an accusation.

729,10363,2452,Jenga,1983,5.56985,"Jenga is tower building game played with 54 wooden blocks; each block is 3 times as long as it is wide, and slightly smaller in height than in width. The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.&#10;&#10;Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.&#10;&#10;The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name &quot;Hoppla - eins zuviel!&quot; According to the designer, the game was developed from Takoradi blocks/bricks. &quot;Jenga&quot; is Swahili for &quot;build&quot;.&#10;&#10;",1,8,20,20,"['Physical Removal', 'Single Loser Game', 'Stacking and Balancing']",6,20,1.1063,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Action / Dexterity', 'Party Game']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1990,17,80,165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11374974145016428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09154387426163503,0.09583047976898644,0.0,0.26352871032957026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1124189538640995,0.12019832861998217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07583518336929977,0.19274363974100894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13413594276153115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1115595494512236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17255784474584657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13176435516478513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12613969418836796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24490638985931248,0.0,0.0,0.13100884374105573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34110673075848985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19842859366234292,0.2590917662527857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10167065484329488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08731126380256038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16976765657547632,0.21980526359324462,0.0,0.12245319492965624,0.0,0.08969782608306077,0.0,0.0,0.10871033703721586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11657662558406601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11707122959950676,0.0,0.0,0.13413594276153115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11912404162563497,0.0,0.0,0.08243420572895549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3199113908673283,0.12549716359277258,0.0,0.0,0.2414966610595792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20398083775905668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10167065484329488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10950058761096063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

You roll 6 dice, and remove any dice you want to use for points. You can stop, keeping the points, or re-roll the remaining dice.  Points can be scored by specific numbers (e.g. 5 or 1) or sets of the same number.

737,26568,2243,Yahtzee,1956,5.45221,"Yahtzee is a classic dice game played with 5 dice.  Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories.  Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc.  Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible.  When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.&#10;&#10;The traditional (public domain) game Yacht predates the trademarked game, and has slightly different scoring.&#10;&#10;There are four basic scoring difference between the tradition game Yacht and Yahtzee.  They are:  1) Yacht has no Three of a Kind category, 2) there are no bonuses in Yacht, 3) there are no Joker rules in Yacht, and 4) the Full House category is scored as the sum of the dice.  The other scoring rules are identical between the two games.&#10;&#10;Travel versions of the game use a device that keeps the dice captured within compartments of a plastic box and allows players to &quot;lock&quot; a particular die between rolls.&#10;&#10;",2,10,30,30,"['Dice Rolling', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Push Your Luck', 'Re-rolling and Locking', 'Set Collection']",6,30,1.1771,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"[""Children's Game"", 'Comic Book / Strip', 'Dice', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Music', 'Travel']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1103,10,56,105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14790039034565922,0.0,0.0,0.14193273078421983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13990866838980162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13798338092889706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5711805761503296,0.13990866838980162,0.0879272068924826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11063140132376362,0.0,0.15126076560544216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10245741315316571,0.0,0.30610947317594833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10790890361081579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15126076560544216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10296989523076756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1156330952854372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22380886637016686,0.0,0.21182816419217343,0.14790039034565922,0.40844302443767827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0946315189342707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14406625390162783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14954481850465204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08918002847662063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15590855077929455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
738,26718,1502,Hotel,1974,5.44165,"Hotel Tycoon, first published as Hotels, is a Monopoly-like game in which hotel tycoons try to buy and build the best hotels in the world and compete for guests. The game caters two to four players, ages eight and up. An average game lasts about 90 minutes.&#10;&#10;Players try to buy and build the best hotels in this game, earning the most money or bankrupting their opponents. A successful hotel consists of three components: the land on which it's built, the hotel buildings, and the entrances by which guests arrive in the hotels. All three components need to be bought separately with in-game money. As in Monopoly, money is earned by players who end up on one of the entrances of your hotels, after their dice roll. The more luxurious the hotel, the more money a guest will earn you. Money you can use to build extensions to your existing hotels, buying new entrances or pay other players when you arrive at their hotels.&#10;&#10;The game consists out of cardboard, three-dimensional hotel buildings, recreational grounds and entrance stairs that can be placed on the large game board.&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,60,"['Auction / Bidding', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Take That']",8,60,1.3993,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Economic'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1104,10,45,102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21161215435364342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27855415024206215,0.0,0.2354942439306324,0.13364632817199876,0.2672926563439975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12794133090038926,0.0,0.2438302111733039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10093322801866315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12247296310161813,0.0,0.12860545290134312,0.0,0.0,0.07691832734947279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09052616524261059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12928247127783246,0.13775287503582925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10344713465888791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328800258776707,0.6014658445970219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10580607717682171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11446876964458047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114723566755876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11583621356975386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2508348080405834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21592676967444469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07879494265726379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09747266907980921,0.0

740,26839,2593,Pass the Pigs,1977,5.42647,"This very portable beer &amp; pretzels game comes as a pocket travel case containing 2 pig dice, two pencils and a scoring booklet that also includes the scoring table. The pigs are actual pig miniatures, with a dot on their right flanks.&#10;&#10;The object is to be the first to score 100 points using &quot;pigs&quot; as dice. On your turn, you throw the pigs and hope they end up in a scoring position such as a &quot;snouter,&quot; &quot;trotter,&quot; or &quot;leaning jowler&quot; (ranging in value from 1 to 60 points); if they do, you decide whether to &quot;cash&quot; the points (pass the pigs to the next player) or to roll again.

Jumping moves must be taken when possible, thereby creating a strategy game where players offer up jumps in exchange for setting up the board so that they jump even more pieces on their turn.

The pencil and paper grids were changed to plastic grids with holes that could hold plastic pegs used to record the guesses.&#10;&#10;Each player deploys his ships (of lengths varying from 2 to 5 squares) secretly on a square grid.  Then each player shoots at the other's grid by calling a location.  The defender responds by &quot;Hit!&quot; or &quot;Miss!&quot;.  You try to deduce where the enemy ships are and sink them.  First to do so wins.&#10;&#10;The Salvo variant listed in the rules allows each player to call out from 1 to 5 shots at a time depending on the amount of ships the player has left (IE: players each start off with 5 ships, so they start off with 5 shots.  As ships are sunk, the players gets fewer shots).  This version of the game is closer to the original pencil-and-paper public domain game.  Many versions of the pencil-and-paper game have different amounts of shots based on the ship (IE: Battleship: 5 shots.

The goal is to move the pawns around the board to the &quot;home&quot; section.  Movement is controlled by dice.  All players move around the same board, so they may capture each others pawns.  Captured pawns are returned to their player's corner and must start their journey over.  The winner is the first player to move all pawns &quot;home&quot;.&#10;&#10;Parcheesi is the westernized version.&#10;&#10;The usual game is for 2-4 players.  Jumbo's version handles up to 6.

If one plays the normal version in which one card is drawn from the deck each turn, the outcome has a huge element of luck.  Sorry can be made more of a strategic game (and more appealing to adults) by dealing five cards to each player at the start of the game and allowing the player to choose which card he/she will play each turn.  In this version, at the end of each turn, a new card is drawn from the deck to replace the card that was played, so that each player is always working from five cards.&#10;&#10;A player's fortunes can change dramatically in one or two rounds of play through the use of Sorry cards, the &quot;11&quot; cards (which give the player the option of trading places with an opponent's piece on the track), and the fact that it is possible to move from Start to Home without circumnavigating the full board by making judicious use of the &quot;backward 4&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,30,"['Roll / Spin and Move', 'Take That']",6,30,1.1624,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"[""Children's Game""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1595,9,68,134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08330332358099816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10807739713519328,0.0,0.0,0.27446651533181593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18673490069823132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1172535060086715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11871955303222897,0.0,0.0,0.08424240011748374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10277523348897578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30026516497602207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08778154518471414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13258103601163962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16478541666680027,0.07801816022009778,0.0,0.1165464615402158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10807739713519328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11201453482212011,0.11451998569906378,0.0,0.11518040796499861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17345424216865715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1032203972384485,0.09865261371001605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3258277022692875,0.0,0.0,0.3307910114012224,0.0,0.0,0.07840839951669702,0.0,0.10704115639602617,0.0,0.08805103581171499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1086092340897625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0921020842900726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40325153506385236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2194040183779362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11026367046707414,0.0,0.0,0.13581568255526258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09179389693718713,0.19966223567196142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10704115639602617,0.0,0.0,0.0
761,27188,3737,Operation,1965,4.5469," Operation is a dexterity game in which you must extract silly body parts from a hapless patient.  In the course of the game you acquire cards which dictate that you must remove a certain piece from the body of the patient.  To do this you use a set of tweezers that are attached by wire to the game board.

763,27192,1406,Monopoly,1935,4.28718,"Theme&#10;Players take the part of land owners, attempting to buy and then develop their land. Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.&#10;&#10;Cultural impact on rules&#10;Monopoly is unusual in that the game has official, printed rules, but most players learn how to play from others, never actually learning the correct way to play. This has led to the canonization of a number of house rules that make the game more palatable to children (and sore losers) but harm the gameplay by preventing players from going bankrupt or slowing down the rate of property acquisition. One common house rule has players put any money paid to the bank in the center of the board, which jackpot a player may earn by landing on Free Parking. This prevents the game from removing money from play, and since players collect $200 each time they pass Go, this results in ever-increasing bankrolls and players surviving rents that should have bankrupted them. Another house rule allows players to take &quot;loans&quot; from the bank instead of going bankrupt, which means the game will never end. Some house rules arise out of ignorance rather than attempts to improve the game. For instance, many players don't know that properties landed on but left unbought go up for auction, and even some that know to auction don't know that the bidding starts at $1, meaning a player may pay well below the listed price for an auctioned property.&#10;&#10;",2,8,60,180,"['Auction / Bidding', 'Auction: English', 'Income', 'Loans', 'Lose a Turn', 'Ownership', 'Player Elimination', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Set Collection', 'Track Movement', 'Trading']",8,180,1.6212,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Economic'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2505,16,87,217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06638319424636904,0.0,0.08020114706680591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07771113288821387,0.08974648654960261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13620217717360142,0.0729061107375073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06376843768948938,0.0,0.08086632351702978,0.0,0.18357114858405552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15037659021946823,0.08190007307188478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06931888384481781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06995182322560432,0.0,0.08411193489028145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05282593952201627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.217996371993763,0.09178557429202776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17949297309920523,0.0,0.060243037289962637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24784469001944692,0.15037659021946823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09343759565454991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08411193489028145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17059904867983494,0.0,0.0,0.28381760094305236,0.0,0.35515426527414695,0.0,0.07712708411975973,0.0,0.0,0.08786749844159941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061712505196198225,0.0,0.0571706916170857,0.0,0.2376111288852687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33045958669259584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11825824848840671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07861481796049048,0.0,0.0,0.08450129001157103,0.07987536228117859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08786749844159941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09232368260879065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27161604331710953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09343759565454991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2786224869273729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08225481752123386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055711673116369875,0.08741991882385554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08120597194042849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0708226396415619,0.0,0.07060194856440892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
