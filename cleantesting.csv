0,14562,275087,Auf der Walz,2019,5.53297,150,2.6667,"Auf der Walz is a game that has the &quot;journeyman years&quot; as the topic. This is a tradition that dates back to medieval times and is still alive in German-speaking countries. A craftsman has to be &quot;Auf der Walz&quot; (roughly translated as &quot;on the road&quot;) for three years and one day without ever getting closer than fifty kilometers to home. The young journeyman wears a traditional dress: flared pants, waistcoat, jacket, black hat (as a symbol for freedom), the &quot;Stenz&quot; (traditional curled hiking pole), and the &quot;Charlottenburger&quot; (coarse cloth to wrap up the belongings). They work (for a little bit of money but also for board and lodge) for people on their journey.&#10;&#10;Auf der Walz is a &quot;travel game&quot; with resource management that takes place in the second half of the 19th century. Like life on the Walz, it includes uncertainty and random elements. Each player earns points at the end of each year on the journey and in an end-scoring after that additional one day.&#10;&#10;The engine of the game is a deck of cards. Each player has six cards per year (and an additional card for the last day) and conducts actions with them: traveling, working, finding travel mates, etc. as well as leisure activities: music, writing, painting.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",2,4,90,150,"['Action Points', 'Hand Management', 'Network and Route Building', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Tile Placement']",10,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Exploration', 'Travel']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1352,11,89,135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13352119848054406,0.0,0.0,0.36089560527654485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15739694731157997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1988842186559727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12654522581081024,0.0,0.15631915531783372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22350241183207356,0.0,0.0,0.19416878725943362,0.0,0.19416878725943362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15905789324923933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16315932545939102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1888318227562628,0.15029372641146757,0.0,0.20013500597475678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12684231940539706,0.0,0.0,0.17476857796358583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1779355036743387,0.19647165257062388,0.0,0.12508534630595597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15321690157586534,0.0,0.0,0.19530713432634458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17476857796358583,0.17178805287778356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15631915531783372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1988842186559727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14323476828301968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12147556700800133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18493341411516884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1493556567755211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18044780263827243,0.17036107646773327,0.0,0.0

Once completed, a bicycle can't be disassembled to move parts to other bikes.&#10;&#10;",2,4,20,20,['Set Collection'],12,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Card Game'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,878,6,48,96,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15526867531097835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1592867883528593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1491528233780231,0.15613700794838484,0.0,0.21468422384269417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1831646792893194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12479497965524948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1967357680889482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15357138380885663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21854826159285537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2804883861747636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16165027546836283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19951351090099081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2024362435822913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6297445417580305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1386207074380909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13431040172342076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18993879149195156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20767429515180655

With increasingly serious global warming, the last area of ice on land at the North Pole is melting and all the polar bears are homeless. Players in this game will be a team formed by all nations to save them. This is a co-operative game for 1-4 players. Players will co-operate with each other by choosing proper actions and card effects, so that they can save all of the homeless polar bears.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a ship of a nation at the beginning of the game and he or she will be the captain of the ship. Different ships have different abilities, which can be improved during the game. Also, there are various cards of 4 main kinds in this game. Captains start with some of them and they can get or use them during the whole game. Rescue Polar Bears is played in turns. In one captain&rsquo;s turn, he has several actions to choose, such as moving, delivering and using cards. A captain has 3 action points per turn, which can be used to choose the actions mentioned above.&#10;&#10;The homeless polar bears stand on ices, waiting the captain&rsquo;s rescue. The ices they stand on is melting with time elapsing, accidentally or step by step. When an ice is melt, the polar bears on it may drop down into the water and face their unlucky fate. So it&rsquo;s crucial for the captains to co-operate with each other by choosing proper actions and card effects before that tragedy.&#10;&#10;The game can be ended by 3 ways: Saving all polar bears, using up time or having a polar bear fall into the water. You group will get scores, based on your performance, in either ending.

7,8431,11091,Leuthen: Frederick's Greatest Victory,1997,5.6033,360,4.0,"December 1757: Not since losing Silesia in 1742 had Austria come so close to regaining the province. With the recent Imperial victory at Breslau (November 22) Austrian forces under Prince Charles of Lorraine and Field-marshal Daun, the victor at Kolin, were only a battle away from that goal. They expected to fight this battle in the new campaign year which would begin in the coming spring.&#10;&#10;For King Frederick II the loss of Silesia would not only be a devastating blow to his prestige but deprived of its resources, revenue and manpower Prussia's ability to continue the war would be desperately compromised. Rather than to allow the enemy to go unchallenged Frederick marched his remaining army of 40,000 men composed of Rossbach veterans and Breslau survivors against Charles' nearly 60,000-strong force of Austrians, Hungarians, Imperials, Bavarians and Wurttembergers.&#10;&#10;On a frigid December 5th, in a season when armies usually sought the comfort of winter quarters, the opposing forces met on the snow covered fields surrounding the Silesian village of Leuthen. After deftly maneuvering around Prince Charles' flank Frederick's Prussians attacked with unprecedented fury collapsing the enemy line. However, despite this initial crushing blow the Austrians were able to reorganize their front and fight the Prussians to a standstill leaving the battle's final outcome still in doubt. Only after a climactic cavalry charge did the Habsburg army finally break and retreat to Breslau. Two weeks later the city capitulated and the Austrians evacuated Silesia. Although the war would continue for another six years Frederick would never again attain the level of success he did at Leuthen, his greatest victory.&#10;&#10;Leuthen (Battles from the Age of Reason, Vol. 3) presents both gamers and students of the period with a colorful and meticulously detailed simulation with which to explore the actual events and possibilities of this definitive battle. Included is an historical commentary written especially for the game by the period's leading authority, Prof. Christopher Duffy. This narrative contains many previously unpublished aspects of the battle and includes maps, diagrams, statistics and his analysis of the 1757 campaign in Silesia.&#10;&#10;",1,2,360,360,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']",16,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Age of Reason', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2277,16,69,222,0.0,0.13905585292649486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12234767818535525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10721771464168095,0.11478269641351811,0.0,0.0,0.14535353930505307,0.0,0.0,0.6779742357388083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12053053183632463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1295012126223855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14286702365859447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14894658895901328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14710727354857603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14535353930505307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13006811785928557,0.11837574606747832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12626793313566695,0.1445063466220835,0.11837574606747832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13763309963112272,0.0,0.0,0.14710727354857603,0.0,0.0,0.1462202093781927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09000900025049365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11754717451990124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14710727354857603,0.0,0.11633749358411725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1480157148036465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2002746651621235,0.0,0.28414668393610504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

11,16831,351903,Giftbringer,2021,5.52262,30,2.0,"Santa has his hands full and Christmas is just around the corner. What is worse, all his Elven helpers aren&rsquo;t well. In such circumstances Santa asked for help from his closest friends - the Vikings. You are the leader of one of the mighty Viking Horde which came to the shores of The Grateful Island. Your goal is to visit the local town homes and &ndash; obviously - deliver presents. Then you can in turn collect the tokens of gratitude left there for Santa!&#10;&#10;Giftbringer is a roll&amp;write game. To play you&rsquo;ll need 4 six-sided dice, the Rulebook and for each placer a pen/pencil and a Player Sheet. Before the start of the game randomly determine the Merry Leader (rolling player).&#10;&#10;The game itself consists of 10 Rounds. At the beginning of each Round the Merry Leader rolls the 4 six-sided dice. All players write down the roll results in the slots for the given Round on their Player Sheets. The results of the roll are the numbers that the players can use that Round. For each die roll the player can cross off a die symbol on one of the Vikings, one of the Roads or one of the Houses. Alternatively he can use one or two of those die rolls for a Special Action (Santa's Blessing), but each Special Action can only be used once per game.&#10;&#10;Initially each player has to Recruit a Viking - without one he cannot Visit the town itself. This also applies if a Viking already delivered all his Presents and the player has to Recruit another one. After having the first available Viking the player has to choose one of the Ships on the map to start his journey (this cannot be changed later, even with a new Viking). From that ship he can then start crossing the die symbols on Roads and Houses to visit them. He cannot jump over Houses or Roads and can only progress to an unvisited Road/House, adjacent to any of his already visited Roads/Houses.&#10;&#10;When a player crosses the die symbol on a Road segment leading to a House (including crossing a potential die symbol on the House itself), he visits the House. Then he has to cross the required number of Presents on his Viking (and the House) in order to get the token of gratitude available there (which he writes down under his Viking). Once all gratitude token spaces of a Viking are filled, that Viking has done his job and cannot be used anymore - the player has to Recruit another one. If a Happiness symbol is also present on the House, after delivering the Presents for that House the player marks the next available Happiness token on his track.&#10;&#10;After completing the last Round the player with the most points will be the winner of the game. Points are scored for each collected token of gratitude and for the achieved level of Happiness on a given player's Happiness track.

Each card has 4 options to chose from and players can play as few as 1 up to their entire hand each round.  They play these Ship cards to control and mine resource laden planets, with all players laying down their chosen cards at the same time. When the resources are divided up (based on a fleet's total Speed, Attack and Cargo) points are awarded accordingly. Then, new Ship cards are dealt, equal to the number that were just played, beginning with the player with the lowest score. New Planets are dealt and the next round begins.  After 3 rounds the game ends and the player with the greatest score emerges victorious!&#10;&#10;",2,4,10,10,"['Hand Management', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']",8,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Science Fiction']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1192,14,53,127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12957302049416086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15327419786893487,0.0,0.0,0.19181872678723164,0.19300327763033506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19421707957890177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1626658010384139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1378148123847248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18953196650950369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24676328652002272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19066205033176517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14539231739203898,0.12138661369776824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1613889375272786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2565415717906996,0.2695776859396549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30654839573786974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2444634632261979,0.15067271883252223,0.16014440317303405,0.0,0.0,0.2638767868492541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17595232257259022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16886151937569516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15435460358562353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22874180632553837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18628970490044244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16397671822689353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

After all players have written their papers, the leader reads aloud all of the answers given by the players adding the correct answer from the card.

The game's main mechanism is similar to a debate in which each player must confront different complications and events that may happen during a round, trying to find clever ways of surviving in order to prove to your fellow survivors that you are the best choice to lead the colony of survivors.&#10;&#10;Tough Calls is a board game that incorporates some aspects of role-playing games, where the competitive part remains in the background while the immersive and narrative part takes more prominence. This can be seen in the different roles that each participant will take, as well as the choice of the scenario and the unique story that players will tell.

Players take the roles of detectives vying to solve the cases and gain fame.&#10;&#10;The story begins at the legendary Rummy Detective Agency, and each case takes you to various locations to solve a crime, including the diner with the best doughnuts in town, the cozy &quot;Quarter to 3 Bar&quot;, a ritzy fashion emporium, the circus, the most elite jazz nightclub in town, and more.&#10;&#10;The cases in Detective Rummy can be played in two different ways: Campaign Mode and Case Mode. In Campaign Mode, you play all seven cases in order. In Case Mode, you can play cases 2 to 6 as standalone Detective Rummy games one at a time. Since new &quot;Game Changer&quot; cards are discovered in each case in different orders (if at all) each time you play, cases will never resolve the same way twice. You can play both the campaign mode or the individual cases as many times as you like.&#10;&#10;",2,4,45,60,"['Hand Management', 'Set Collection']",14,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Murder / Mystery']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1014,8,48,97,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22809966828368775,0.17630203689459817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3883488168059334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18574361760434374,0.0,0.1588673802688052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21318546006623612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17237138960168347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13870840084054487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14756252631243333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15159599397714346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2266997145746395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18439250397187076,0.0,0.0,0.41997349514646437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2266997145746395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16427549331384064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2703370159619826,0.21209953559567188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17747571858376004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17183096461004468,0.21894217257848447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
27,16841,33857,Prince of Chaos: Battle for Tae Orn,2008,5.52258,120,4.2593,"Prince of Chaos: Battle for Tae Orn is a Dark Fantasy strategic and tactical wargame. Play as one of four Princes, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. Accumulate resources by exploration, building mines and temples, and fighting for key positions. In addition to resource and strategic management, you also manage the details of your units&rsquo; Formations, Fatigue, Damage Levels, Rank, Ammunition, etc. The combat dynamics revolve around a richly detailed and heavily researched simulation of the four primary weapon systems of ancient warfare: Light Infantry, Heavy Infantry, Light Cavalry and Heavy Cavalry. Learning how to use each unit to maximum effectiveness is paramount to achieving victory. Additionally, unique fantasy units, including flying units, as well as a variety of spells from Enchantments, Curses, and Area of Effect are included. The game comes with highly detailed Record Sheets customized to each Prince&rsquo;s units in order to track the various in-game details.&#10;&#10;Though random events add flavor to the game, luck has been minimized to emphasize strategy and tactics. Battles do not hinge on the outcome of a die roll, but rather reward planning and superior positioning. A modular game board provides new terrain configurations every time you play, and terrain plays a key element in how you develop your strategy and tactics as terrain effects are customized for each unit. Each Prince has their own unique and highly detailed handbook describing each of their unit types in great detail, and each unit is further broken down into easy-to-reference sections within the handbooks. Unlike many games where you wait for another player to complete their turn before taking your own, this game is designed to keep everyone equally involved during all aspects of play, including the Movement and Attack phases. Though not recommended for the casual gamer, Prince of Chaos: Battle for Tae Orn provides a robust challenge for anyone who desires to plumb the depths and details of ancient fantasy warfare.&#10;&#10;",2,4,120,120,"['Grid Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Variable Player Powers']",12,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2051,14,59,193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13290621287542845,0.15037796681796248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11285446789465992,0.12081716319502768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28544694083918737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11062285286112339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15123134184039574,0.0,0.14636643153702303,0.0,0.12977192039619098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14068813151164056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15210347385166803,0.0,0.0,0.11521910669375592,0.13290621287542845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2060564535697602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10851008874001994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13078942253453057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15210347385166803,0.0,0.291221182734031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12877985849539542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14792272548210286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09474104034904393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1007886124752052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14135504484306827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1529952059666483,0.0,0.12372697811455796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13183370409629253,0.0,0.0,0.2585455783432262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26473267007020324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.137512004121675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09232321179499843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14486887988120573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14203335895295394,0.33758363496424104,0.0896768707681104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15390743945596738,0.12122001344856342,0.0,0.0,0.10540184914959069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11699879550980949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Each one of them has a unique set of traits: movement, attack power, abilities, etc. At the beginning of a game, the player will configure the abilities the hero will be able to use during the fight: these abilities will make the hero more defensive, capable of helping other heroes and/or having access to powerful attacks.&#10;&#10;The y&#197;&#141;kai are the enemies of the game: inspired in the ones from the Japanese folklore, these supernatural beings will follow &ldquo;behavior cards&rdquo;, so their acting is managed by the own players.

The y&#197;&#141;kai will be constantly spawning from settled points in random amounts, decided by drawing cards from their specific deck.&#10;&#10;Heroes and Y&#197;&#141;kai take turns to play: they will move, attack and use abilities while fighting in the tiled boards. The gameplay has a staged feeling, represented by the different scenarios.

35,26113,89423,Garbage,0,5.46847,30,1.0,"This traditional children's card game is a game of very few decisions (none of which are meaningful).  Players are each dealt 10 face down cards which are arranged in spots from #1-10 to begin.  One player then draws a card from the top of the stock of remaining cards and uses it to replace a face-down card in the appropriately numbered spot if possible.  His turn continues until he draws a card that matches a card number already flipped or draws a Queen or King which cannot be placed in his array.  He discards the unusable card and his opponent can then choose to pick up that card and begin his turn by placing it into the appropriate spot in his array.  Jacks are considered wild and can be replaced by the appropriate number if they are already placed in one's array.  The first person to fill all of his spots with face-up cards wins the round and will play the next round with one less spot (so after round 1, for example, he will only use 9 cards).  The game continues until one person has no spots remaining at the beginning of his turn.&#10;&#10;",2,3,30,30,[],3,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', ""Children's Game""]",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1061,8,26,102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4000504840756048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2012387215297176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2012387215297176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14458273765377738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2012387215297176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45197060271021466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15253236512549118,0.2546955384440244,0.0,0.0,0.17715411234286488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3297649333977978,0.0,0.18371156818633472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15111938635597366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3847031696879287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18115382918553138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11654821783787736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11848536572813109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Hire the inhouse experts to get more information on the objects before you make your bid.&#10;&#10;Every round, five objects will be auctioned off. All objects are visible for all the players to see. The auction will start with the object furthest on the left, continuing to the object on the right. For each object, a round of bidding will occur.&#10;&#10;All objects have two values in gold. One value for an authentic object and one value for a replica. You will only find out if the objects are authentic or not after you&rsquo;ve bought the item. But before the bidding starts, you can hire the help of an expert to check if the object(s) is authentic or a replica. Bidding will happen simultaneously in the first round. After the first round, the player with the most credits left, will become the profiteer. When there is a profiteer, bidding will occur in clockwise order, with the profiteer bidding last. Bids will be placed face down, but players can see how many cards are used in the bid.&#10;&#10;The objects are divided into four categories: potions, familiars, gear and magic items. When you win more objects of the same category, you gain bonus points (depending on the duration of the game). Gear objects belong to sets of two or three. When you&rsquo;ve collected a complete set, the total value of that set will be doubled. Therefore, it is encouraged to try and win as many of the same category objects as you can, but your opponents will of course know that you want certain objects. That&rsquo;s why it is allowed to trade with the other players. You can trade objects, or you can buy objects from other players by paying credits.

Activated cards can help you or hurt your opponents, depending on what happens in the storyline.

However, with each additional 20 cards you add to your deck, one more player can be added. 5 is the recommended maximum. 20 card expansion sets can be purchased that also include a new miniature.

53,23202,6333,Mighty Warriors,1991,5.49758,60,1.2,"Mighty Warriors was produced in the early 1990s by Games Workshop as part of a series of introductory-level miniatures games. The four-game series included Mighty Warriors, Ultra Marines, Kerrunch, and Space Fleet. The game includes dice, floor tiles, door stand-ups, 36 highly detailed Citadel Miniatures, and reference cards for army lists and spells.&#10;&#10;In Mighty Warriors, players choose from either a band of Heroes or Skaven Ratmen. The Heroes are led by a Noble Knight, a Fearless Dwarf, and a Heroic Elf while the Skaven Ratmen are led by a Chaos Wizard and four Skaven Champions. The Elf and Chaos Wizard can cast spells. The other characters have differing combat abilities.&#10;&#10;Players set up the castle from modular floor tiles, which are then connected by stand-up doors. The players then position their forces throughout the rooms of the castle. Finally a &ldquo;shield&rdquo; for each side is placed.&#10;&#10;The game is played in phases including Magic, Movement, Missile Combat, Melee Combat, and Recovery from Stuns. Each player attacks the other while moving from one room of the castle to another. A player wins by capturing the opponent&rsquo;s shield.&#10;&#10;This game is basically a &ldquo;light&rdquo; version of HeroQuest or Warhammer Quest, more of a skirmish style than exploration, Dungeon Crawl.

57,17672,42257,Battle Spirits: Trading Card Game,2009,5.51923,45,1.5,"A new collectible card game brought to us from BANDAI JAP. English version distributed by BANDAI AMERICA. The game is anime stylized but is not based on an anime (until later versions) it was created by Michael Elliott, game designer for MTG, and also creator of Duel Masters.&#10;&#10;There are six different categories of cards. Each represented by a different Gem stone. Ruby, Diamond, Amethyst, Sapphire, Topaz, and Emerald. Each gem set possesses specific powers, abilities, and types of spirits which are unique to each gem set.&#10;&#10;The game is based around a &quot;core&quot; concept. Each player begins with 5 life which is represented by gems included with the game; also players begin with 4 &quot;core&quot; in their reserve that are also represented by the same gems used to indicate your life total. The goal of the game is to reduce your opponents life to zero, or through &quot;crushing&quot; your opponents deck so they can no longer draw any cards.&#10;&#10;As players receive damage from their opponents actions their life transfers from your life area to your reserve where you can pay for spirits, spells, and nexus's essentially adding a balance to the game; so that even though you may be on the receiving end of an assault you are gaining the ability to respond with a counter attack. Your reserve refreshes at the beginning of every turn with each core you had spent on the previous turn and you gain 1 additional core every turn.&#10;&#10;The game at its base is very simplistic, but as you play in more advanced degrees it tends to have a &quot;poker&quot; feel to it, as you can bluff and certain plays give away &quot;tells&quot; and whatnot, it takes about 45 minutes to play a match (best 2 of 3 games)&#10;&#10;Although the game requires basic strategy, there is a lot of involvement in the deck building process, because your resources are on a differing track from your deck there is no mulligan, such as in MTG, however you only begin with 4 core in reserve so you want to include spirits and cards in your deck that work with your &quot;core&quot; production curve. This concept makes a large portion of the spirits and spells in the game to be very attractive to deck building which makes individual cards very cost effective.&#10;&#10;Battle Spirits is currently on it's 4th edition with the 5th set releasing Sept. 10th. It is relatively unknown because it is only distributed to local hobby retailers and online hobby stores. It is currently unknown when the game will hit the mass market, but is expected to gain high popularity with the younger crowd as the anime will be hitting US airways hopefully in the spring of 2011.&#10;&#10;BANDAI AMERICA will send you a free demo deck (all constructed with cards from the first set) they are white backed which indicates they are not approved for sanctioned tournament play, however they are adequate for casual gaming and can give you a good taste of the game mechanics.&#10;&#10;For more information please see Bandaicg.com/battlespirits regarding how to play, how to obtain your free demo deck, you can also watch videos on YouTube by searching for &quot;Bandai CG&quot;.&#10;&#10;On behalf of the Battle Spirits community, I warmly welcome you to the game! &#10;-Brandon Anderson (Top 8 X-championship GenCon 2010)&#10;&#10;",2,4,45,45,[],10,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Collectible Components']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3318,22,152,276,0.08542710371799153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06555103792582201,0.0,0.0,0.08858923443603021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07571784937752284,0.0,0.0,0.09588429039809244,0.0,0.15508294426167632,0.1788936927516419,0.0,0.09704116324956204,0.09764042794946023,0.07546791479477634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13865785769409852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08433780776043272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43488372585012397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11082449162658302,0.0,0.07264962512880996,0.0,0.0,0.07449256305331486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05486325482860227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07546791479477634,0.0,0.14441893412060502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1590189626160539,0.0,0.06800482926333605,0.0,0.0,0.1788936927516419,0.0,0.0,0.07808804977362087,0.0,0.09079140526275017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09079140526275017,0.0,0.16658846047550377,0.09532542908913931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09825449079419046,0.0,0.09079140526275017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4635264705514739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061693743793762953,0.0,0.0,0.09477885144635662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24494016557564555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08858923443603021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08988700444432839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07754147213083816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08505867799192263,0.0,0.24620492704407435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07674349088669163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09825449079419046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08295588105030952,0.0,0.0,0.07031982812365699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0873558437344794,0.09424402907756091,0.09079140526275017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0890143436195662,0.07052283563188048,0.0,0.07378536046803677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08262207360000998,0.09825449079419046,0.0,0.07864691108257399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08363724645751654,0.0,0.0
58,15692,4877,How to Host a Murder: The Watersdown Affair,1985,5.5274,180,2.5556,"THE WATERSDOWN AFFAIR &#10;By separate invitation, you and a select few others have been invited to Watersdown Mansion as the weekend guests of Sir Roger Watersdown. As Sir Roger's guest, I thought you might be interested in some information about the mansion and, perhaps, about the other guests that will be present during your stay. I have enclosed a brief biography of each guest. Watersdown Mansion is an old, elegant stone building situated in Yorkshire, England, and constructed in 1817. The original owner, Lord Balmy Farfrummit, made his fortune selling English pig iron to the French after Bonaparte's defeat in 1815. Roger Watersdown acquired the entire Farfrummit holdings in 1925 after the tragic death of Viscount Farfrummit aboard his sailing yacht, Frummit's Ferry, which foundered during a fierce storm off Falmouth Harbor. Sir Roger, as you may know, is the principal shareholder of the giant conglomerate Watersdown Beverages Ltd., and known far and wide as a jovial host. Female guests are cautioned that Sir Roger, after consumption of his customary evening cocktails, tends to become something of a leech. I welcome you on behalf of Sir Roger and the entire Watersdown Mansion household, and I hope your stay will be a pleasant one.&#10;&#10;CHARACTERS&#10;Dr. Malcom K.T. Praktiss, Miranda T.

63,7364,311920,Ultimate Werewolf: Extreme,2021,5.63146,60,2.4,"In Ultimate Werewolf Extreme, 3-25 players will use their wits to deceive and uncover deception by fellow players as they attempt to discover who among them is a werewolf. Like traditional werewolf games, Ultimate Werewolf Extreme has all sorts of roles and a moderator to run the game, but Extreme reworks this in several ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;     A free, moderator assisting app that helps create and execute games with ease - automatically scanning each player's face and role using micro QR code technology&#10;    An abundance of information on each card: role name, role description, role art, team, traditional balance value, info value, moderator difficulty, wake order, wake frequency, game length impact, and special considerations.&#10;     A new role-balancing system based on information vs. the number of werewolves in any size game.&#10;     Optional rules to increase difficulty, such as invisible Lycans, alternate nominees, celebrations after werewolf elimination that reduce village abilities, and elected judges that determine whether a nominated player is eliminated or not.&#10;     Enough cards in the base game to play three simultaneous games of Ultimate Werewolf Extreme.&#10;&#10;&#10;Most importantly, the game is integrated with a new app that makes moderating easier than ever before. No more writing down all of the roles and who is assigned to them, or trying to remember some of the complex interactions that happen when using multiple special abilities. The app has two major parts: A deck configuration tool, and a game moderator assistant. The deck configuration tool creates a deck based on user-set parameters, such as number of players, moderator difficulty, info value, or traditional role balance.&#10;&#10;The game moderator assistant automatically scans cards, player names, and player faces, placing them into the app and using that information to run the game. While a moderator is still required to run the game and monitor the app, much of the critical bookkeeping, such as tracking the players who are still in the game, which actions should happen in what order at night, and timing each of the games all happen automatically. This app is not needed to play, but it will make moderating a breeze with a timer, turn order, and loads of special features!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",3,25,30,60,"['Player Elimination', 'Role Playing', 'Team-Based Game', 'Traitor Game', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Voting']",8,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Deduction', 'Horror', 'Murder / Mystery', 'Negotiation', 'Party Game']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2357,13,106,188,0.1764357004322264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0676924698786555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10083016130709097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16014921907119584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09020959862469838,0.19246739058594073,0.0,0.15850111942114156,0.09901665396898805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08241082690820316,0.0,0.0,0.09843953568803168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07502295488124283,0.0,0.0,0.09423742037218127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2809056882803742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10146428445656024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07619579260698157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06618633052652426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0643064171337541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09236891047991837,0.0996070404924097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12683133664817917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19568752698657751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09148328193399734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07767778160212127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47071279325061965,0.20042263946130476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07282668707962459,0.2903464272103758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06356199739646833,0.0,0.0,0.08899611228123137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21911415574973808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20166032261418193,0.0,0.09472659102361862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0856658972449823,0.0,0.06158558531722537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0856658972449823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05803779030699371,0.0,0.23694494874302807,0.2612789068839144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0967821424034586,0.0,0.10021131973065238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Next to the board lies a face-down pile with the remaining tiles. Each player receives a player board, and on this board you will build a city. In your turn, you have to perform actions of the architect which will enable you to take one tile from the main board. In the current turn, you can perform two more actions. You may exchange all of the revealed tiles with those from the pile, place a tile on your board, or change the places of two tiles on your board. Each building added to the city results in its development: number of residents, number of workplaces, ecology, revenue or the satisfaction of residents either increases or decreases. The most important thing is to fill the board with city tiles so that each tile is connected to the center of the board. You cannot forget to fulfill the needs of the residents. The winner is the player who not only builds and develops the city fastest, but avoids unemployment and takes care of the residents' needs.&#10;&#10;",2,4,40,60,['Tile Placement'],10,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['City Building', 'Economic', 'Real-time']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1405,13,43,128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1673776795929163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16910563767768025,0.08851206331936955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12389220097543863,0.0,0.0,0.12544125309903648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6090572891629932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11152697871621997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09390623380896239,0.1231451248464058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09275158763401799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0870576439650119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0996948102472087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09831418966226414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0787642424005938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09390623380896239,0.15680277928914801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07840138964457401,0.1015095481938322,0.23301322556250043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08977714185112813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3127144729542599,0.4710078899529501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07175266826353388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10113820746273854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0887610784827448,0.0

(Destination: Treasure Island) is formally a race game, but in fact you need to employ tactics to meet challenges, complete missions and earn victory points. Your decisions will largely influence your score, although elements of luck are also present in the game.&#10;&#10;2-4 pirate ships set to sea to reach Treasure Island ahead of the others. But being the first is not enough: the real winner will be the one who scores best in the various challenges on the way. &#10;The pirates (48 character cards) have certain skills of different strength which can be boosted by using the appropriate weapons and tools (24 weapon cards). The set of cards held by players in hand continuously changes as cards are played and replaced during actions. This determines the actual power of a player&rsquo;s crew when facing a particular challenge.  Playing the cards tactfully can earn considerable advantage and valuable treasures for players, which will improve their final score.&#10;&#10;The game starts with an empty board and a series of blank fields on the sea, leading to Treasure Island. As the ships move ahead, the board is gradually filled with event cards randomly drawn, all indicating an action. Players will gather and sell pearls, trade with weapons, spy out and occupy islands, collect treasures, complete various missions or even kidnap other&rsquo;s sailors.  Often they master their skills to compete against each other or fight the forces of nature.&#10;&#10;The winner will be the player who achieves the most victory points by sailing fast, completing missions and having a valuable collection of treasures.&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher:&#10;Ir&aacute;ny a Kincses Sziget!&#10;Verseng&eacute;s &eacute;s k&uuml;zdelem a tengeren&#10;&#10;Az Ir&aacute;ny a Kincses sziget! formailag egy versenyj&aacute;t&eacute;k, de a gy&#197;&#145;zelemhez j&oacute; taktik&aacute;ra &eacute;s n&eacute;mi szerencs&eacute;re is sz&uuml;ks&eacute;g van. &#10;N&eacute;h&aacute;ny kal&oacute;zhaj&oacute; nagy zs&aacute;km&aacute;ny rem&eacute;ny&eacute;ben nekiv&aacute;g a tengernek, hogy a t&ouml;bbiek el&#197;&#145;tt &eacute;rjen el a Kincses szigetre.

Players must do all of this while not only surviving the dangers of the island, but also avoiding the Thief.&#10;&#10;The Thief will hunt your players throughout the entire game; always trying to steal resources and deal damage to any player they cross paths with. Once the Treasure has been revealed, the Thief will only engage the player that is in possession of it. During this period of the game, the Thief will ignore other players in an attempt to get to the treasure. If the Thief manages to steal the treasure and get back to their ship the game is over.&#10;&#10;",2,6,60,120,"['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Team-Based Game']",10,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Adventure'],False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1223,10,36,104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08235763136401919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08990182099321573,0.0,0.0,0.07114829058690285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08777030009033934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06772441511072799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0734788411776857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1486231252910775,0.0,0.05945175447802764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11521526126688485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07090339716431641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17762253293911673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08777030009033934,0.08156799046719089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11631879980945836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1427916631144912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07638111512968487,0.0,0.0,0.08777030009033934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07831725242650044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8990182099321573,0.0,0.07638111512968487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06994920423521087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The Confederate garrison actually outnumbered the Union troops 18,000 to 15,000, but Grant's judgement of his opponent's psychology served him well. The unconditional surrender of the fort on Febuary 16th, 1862, shattered the Confederate defenses in western and middle Tennessee.The equivalent of an entire corps was taken prisoner, and the Cumberland River was opened to the Union Navy. Within weeks Nashville would fall and the remaining Confederate forces would retreat into Mississippi. The victory made a national hero of it's previously unknown author, who here began his rise to command of all the Union armies - U.S. Grant. Yet the battle could have turned out much differently, and the controversy in later years over what really happened and why, would be among the most intense surrounding any action of the war.&#10;&#10;",2,2,90,90,"['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']",12,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['American Civil War', 'Civil War', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1103,12,42,119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25589811658737305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33200118775177107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34786364875544323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.336991806935673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3517920701388199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33200118775177107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31708104924572994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2451841943446258,0.0,0.34786364875544323,0.0,0.0,0.2721608363402765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The game covers the desert battles around El Alamein from July 1 through July 18, 1942. The British Commonwealth 8th Army must hold the line against the battered Panzerarmee Afrika, since Alexandria and the virtually undefended Nile Delta lie less than 100 miles to the east.&#10;&#10;The map depicts the battlefield of El Alamein, from the Mediterranean Sea in the north, to the virtually impassable Qattara Depression in the south.&#10;&#10;The game system tries out some unusual mechanics to simulate the fast-paced flow of desert warfare. Combat units are rated for firepower and assault strength, while AFVs have an armor rating, and artillery has an anti-tank rating.  HQs are used for activation of units in their formation. Rules of interest are Opportunity Fire, Overruns, Reaction Movement and Withdrawal Fire, Airstrikes and Fortifications.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by points gained through objective hexes, enemy units eliminated, and for occupying portions of the 'coast road'... the player with the most points wins.

Move around the board as you win challenges, throwing dice to decide the difficulty of the action.&#10;&#10;TWISTED EYES&#10;&#10;A party game in which players have to draw while wearing glasses that distort what they see.&#10;&#10;The game is played in teams. The goal is to be the first team to reach the finish space on the board. The board shows a track consisting of green, yellow and blue spaces. The active team rolls a colour die and moves their pawn to the next space of the corresponding colours. A member of that team inserts the glasses of the same colour (different amounts of distortion) and rolls the die again to select which of the three words from the card he/she has to draw. He/she then tries to draw, wearing the glasses, so that his/her teammates manage to guess the word within the amount of time specified by the timer. If the team is successful, they roll the die again and move their pawn to the next space of that colour. If the time runs out before they have guessed correctly, the team's pawn stays where it is.&#10;&#10;The team who reaches the finish space first wins the game&#10;&#10;GOOGLY EYES is the hilarious family game that challenges your vision and leaves you googling for more! Put on the zany, vision-altering google eye glasses and start to draw while your team tries to guess what you're drawing. Is that an igloo or a turtle? A birthday cake or a fortress? Players take turns drawing and guessing, so everyone gets a chance to wear the glasses. The glasses come with three sets of lenses that range from mild changes to mind-blowing fun, so no one can see (or draw) straight--your vision will bounce off of the lenses. Googly Eyes is a fun twist on classic drawing games that lets players of different ages and skill levels compete on equal terms, since the goggles make it fun and challenging for everyone. Unlike any other drawing game you don't need to be an artist, and the rules are simple. Just roll the die and move--the space you land on tells you which color lenses to use (easy, medium, or hard). Then pick a card, set the timer, and start drawing. If your team guesses correctly you get to roll and move again; if not, then you stay where you are on the board. The first team to reach Finish wins.&#10;&#10;",4,12,45,45,"['Acting', 'Dice Rolling', 'Line Drawing', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Team-Based Game', 'Voting']",9,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Humor', 'Party Game']",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2433,23,98,208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04949243998557191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05435564454560579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061061154066805415,0.0,0.0,0.061325636193177095,0.0,0.06551020845974215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05168116324477904,0.2531823746229758,0.07955768320580751,0.0,0.26076527743043354,0.3526702237665455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11958901655881161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06966303215488745,0.0,0.06803898422910383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06924296060890466,0.2753301869629443,0.0,0.0,0.04881869146061366,0.04491460438852156,0.06484893963959425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05605714255817881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06619691685242321,0.0705340447533091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04601017613654823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20610639051941307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10835244753796863,0.10560459712351099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04658425187167513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06883254674073608,0.0,0.0,0.1338222015345426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17793595966380635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05062629508720059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12212230813361083,0.0,0.044185841283803026,0.12905453873853928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06619691685242321,0.06966303215488745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.298972541397029,0.06924296060890466,0.0,0.0,0.09583244240588709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5359645550378056,0.0,0.08562383215314841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08307243028934395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06517651244493844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0521530554860867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040345626254815484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04881869146061366,0.0,0.0,0.08203242179098709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The first 10 cards represent the trip out; the second 10, time over the target area; and the final 10, the trip home, by which point you will likely be damaged and running low on ballast and gas.&#10;&#10;A separate &quot;ballast sheet,&quot; or Zeppelin schematic, is used to keep track of the condition of your craft and crew. Five different Zeppelin models are provided, from the Type M converted passenger liner to the mammoth Type X &quot;war Zeppelin.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game's components are a step above desktop publishing quality; cards and counters must be cut apart before play.

99,20447,13388,The Moscow Option: Guderian's Gambit,1996,5.50903,0,2.2857,"(from the introduction:)&#10;&#10;The Moscow Option: Guderian's Gambit is a simulation of the fighting that could have taken place between Smolensk and Moscow during the first half of August 1941 if Hitler had decided to concentrate his eastern armies' supply in order to allow the mechanized forces of Army Group Center to make the 150 miles to the Soviet capital city. Historically, of course, the German dictator chose instead to halt the AGC, temporarily de-emphasizing Moscow as a target while diverting his forces' strength on the front's northern and southern sectors.

On a turn, a player rolls the dice. The color result indicates the farm they should visit in this turn. They loudly state which animal they want to feed, then reveal one of the food tiles on the corresponding farm. If food corresponds to the animal, then they claim the corresponding animal from the center of the table and the food from the farm, then place these items on their game area. If they fail, the animal remains in the center of the table and the food flips back down.&#10;If the dice roll shows the wild card, the player can visit any farm they want.&#10;&#10;When one type of animal runs out from the center of the table, a player can still take the food from a farm to feed their own animals. If one type of animals runs out and player doesn't have this species, they can steal another's player animal in order to feed it, so they take the food from the farm and the stolen animal, which is placed in their game area. A hungry wolf also prowls among the farms, and if you run into the wolf, it steals your food.&#10;&#10;The game ends immediately when food runs out at one farm, then the player with the most food wins.

If he does, he keeps the threat card, and whichever team has collected the most threats at game end wins.&#10;&#10;",3,6,20,20,"['Storytelling', 'Team-Based Game', 'Voting']",14,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,"['Card Game', 'Horror', 'Party Game', 'Zombies']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,996,9,42,121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22050221103305612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18602787463684195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17209393009290397,0.22567754713400806,0.12836324075470948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19488302986924957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1699779087165472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20074826813370994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22704664971547672,0.2920818963588326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22567754713400806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2913953554282714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22433992098019287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14367952713478038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22433992098019287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19409139622770735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18017201411034986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3578940777263272,0.0,0.22567754713400806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22704664971547672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1336805616950437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
112,13437,180355,Visby,2015,5.53963,30,1.2,"Visby is a short, but challenging game. Each player has an identical set of eight cards, each of them with a special effect.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a round, the common supply on the board becomes more attractive by adding seals (victory points) and wares and by improving the ratio to change wares into seals. All players choose one card from their hand simultaneously and place it face down in front of them (two cards in a two- or three-player game). Then the cards are revealed and the effects become active:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Knights and Troops take victory points;&#10;     Blacksmith gets wares for each Knight/Troops played by other players;&#10;     Ships and Fleets get wares; Tollkeeper gets seals for ships and fleets;&#10;     Merchant changes wares into seals;&#10;     Monk gets wares for merchants and number of cards already played.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players with a monk take all cards back to their hand, while others proceed with their remaining cards.&#10;&#10;The specific issue is that the more efficient cards become effective only after those which are not that strong. For example, a fleet gets you three wares, but the ship gets you all the remaining ones. If there are ten wares and one opponent played a fleet, you get the seven remaining wares after he has taken three. If three other players play a fleet and take three wares each, you gain only one for your ship. How effective your card is depends on what the other players do &mdash; but you cannot be sure of what they'll do because all decisions are made simultaneously. Perhaps, though, you remember which cards the others have already played...&#10;&#10;Visby comes in a basic set for two players and can be enlarged with one or two expansion packs that contain material for two additional players each (to the maximum of six players).&#10;&#10;",2,2,20,30,"['Commodity Speculation', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']",10,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Economic', 'Medieval']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1834,15,97,146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10671065096858769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23237321415005946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930791645147184,0.0,0.0,0.19154716851472345,0.11689146843894756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11689146843894756,0.0,0.0,0.11835298882513977,0.0,0.0,0.08398228922746064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11049380803214301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11049380803214301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11689146843894756,0.10671065096858769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08751050666000737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1154979508647851,0.0,0.0,0.09577358425736172,0.0,0.0,0.15072941555732564,0.5440681769584033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1503738628717988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11416638827823918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07501020392721934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07397119020450034,0.0,0.0,0.10290168897091591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21142410194192382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07397119020450034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31266520787110835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07448619244532247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14828375142759684,0.0,0.10827388699014974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09244179523906174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08519521710118358,0.11835298882513977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11761331603855414,0.3591824517305804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15913828825186435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

118,22364,113544,Monopoly: Klingon Edition,2011,5.50146,0,2.5,"A spinoff of the original 1935 Hasbro game, this 2011 Klingon edition (released November 17th) follows the same format.  There is a &quot;Go&quot; square in one corner, and players roll dice to travel around the squares lining the edge of the board in circles trying to acquire properties.&#10;&#10;What seems like the biggest difference between the editions (i.e. the fact that you are trying to take over the galaxy) actually involves no changes from the original edition other than name changes.  &quot;Properties&quot; are &quot;galaxy systems&quot; such as Qo'noS, Romulus or Earth (home base of the enemy Federation), and they are &quot;conquered&quot; instead of &quot;owned&quot;.  The most ultimately valuable &quot;property&quot; (equivalent to Boardwalk in the original game), is now called Kronos, and the equivalent of Park Place is Khitomer.  The equivalents of the valuable green properties in the original are Boreth, Ty&rsquo;Gokor and Krios Prime, and so on. The standard money is replaced by &quot;Klingon Force&quot; scrip. &quot;Houses&quot; are renamed &quot;Outposts&quot; (and redone as small yellow dome-shaped constructs) and &quot;Hotels&quot; are renamed &quot;Capitals&quot; (miniature red versions of the Klingon High Council Building). &quot;Railroads&quot; are &quot;Starships&quot;: the Raptor, the Negh'Var, the Vor'Cha and the K'T'inga; and the &quot;Utilities&quot; are now the Rura Penthe Mines and the Praxis Energy Facility.&#10;&#10;The REAL differences lie in the facts that, for one, &quot;Combat&quot; cards replace &quot;Chance&quot; cards.  Furthermore, the element of &quot;Honor&quot; replaces the &quot;Community Chest&quot;.  The penalty of the &quot;Luxury Tax&quot; is replaced by a penalty of losing a battle against Starfleet.&#10;&#10;Another difference which does not affect gameplay, but which does add a lot to the feel of the game is that the board, cards, and rules are all bi-lingual: written in both Klingon and English.&#10;&#10;In order to attain victory and &quot;preserve the glory of the Klingon Empire&quot;, players must conquer all of the systems in the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Two editions were released, a standard &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; and a 1701-unit-released &quot;Limited Edition&quot; that includes a miniature replica of Chancellor Gorkon's bone cane from STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY.&#10;&#10;Both versions include as standard equipment: the gameboard, 6 Collectible tokens, 28 Title Deed Cards, 16 COMBAT cards, 16 HONOR cards, 2 Dice, 32 Outposts, 12 Capitals, 1 Pack of Klingon Forces, and Rules.&#10;&#10;Like most of their MONOPOLY releases, this does not include the &quot;Speed Die&quot;, although the rules mention both classic &quot;speed-up game&quot; options.&#10;&#10;",2,6,0,0,"['Auction / Bidding', 'Player Elimination', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Set Collection', 'Trading']",8,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Negotiation']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2772,19,223,235,0.0,0.0,0.12307452354578009,0.0,0.0,0.11348189589593294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09636072460372118,0.10315966755437408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12186435578631245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0944552613493212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13063487146652344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25825759412797067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19616772696648094,0.12012648279250615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4059612417958836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12698822667915444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11689726951044875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12369621246110164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10638888083643147,0.0,0.0,0.1206959263693811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20105360410624357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11689726951044875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08605830066896254,0.4655510790192679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08366570014652043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1125661348717628,0.0,0.0,0.11037949908857933,0.28824559883509604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1212751044945974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13063487146652344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22604184300486801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2677281694971617,0.08999731023593142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

122,12345,289784,Bank Heist,2020,5.54821,60,2.0,"Bank Heist  is a social deduction game for 5 - 8 players with an explosive action phase. The game sets itself apart from other popular social deduction games by not allowing player eliminations until a secondary phase of the game.&#10;&#10;Players are randomly dealt a secret identity card that could read Agent, Rival, or Crew. Agents get to know if they have a comrade as do Rivals. Crew usually have the numbers advantage but are always in the dark.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 2 primary phases: The Robbery and the Getaway. During the Robbery players try to load cash into the truck before the police arrive at the bank. Players draw and pass cards to observe what the receiving players do with those cards in order to figure out who they can trust. Crew must place cash bags into the truck. There is one Crew member that has &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; and must keep cash bags even though they win or lose with the Crew. Agents try to stop the Robbery by keeping cash bags. Rivals need a successful robbery, but will try to eliminate the others before the end of the game. Not all cards are cash. The deck is filled with items such as Adrenaline, Zip Ties, Knives, and more.&#10;&#10;As the Robbery moves along, players also flip over Alarm cards which cause instant actions to happen such as checking other players Identity card for a Crew Tattoo or showing your hand to a player you trust. Additionally, there are Attribute cards such as Martial Skills or Gun Jammed which can enhance or hinder player abilities.&#10;&#10;If the Robbery is successful, play moves to the Getaway. During this phase players will use the information and items they collected during the Robbery to eliminate those they don't trust before the truck reaches the Hideout. Each faction has different abilities during this phase that will help them achieve their specific win conditions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",5,8,30,60,"['Betting and Bluffing', 'Deduction', 'Hidden Roles', 'Player Elimination', 'Roles with Asymmetric Information', 'Team-Based Game', 'Traitor Game']",13,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Party Game', 'Spies / Secret Agents']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1927,19,73,174,0.31002308333477835,0.0,0.0,0.1251010164636138,0.11894547520097132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1493239945296538,0.0,0.16230555585465792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17006024362507874,0.0,0.0,0.11273102840425996,0.0,0.13925471328811884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10054815482362693,0.0,0.131826199211328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995519845779505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1369401198170047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12339799625814991,0.11352971614863104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11326191311022284,0.13973222758037732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3500479975385819,0.146448838824689,0.1782874454462407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15999096238354377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11299569003993606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1369401198170047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11461711044101767,0.0,0.15924508293019302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11143051535152285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1177500495437782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13649111432606947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16152075903837154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.163104243599029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1782874454462407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.419196682741132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1019808046604667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24679599251629983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Whoever is first to gather 20 magic, wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",2,6,15,30,"['Open Drafting', 'Set Collection']",12,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Card Game'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,709,9,39,71,0.22708889980107827,0.24384359043847056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25340138987246585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24258437561088464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20400545206219498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14730109519792958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6340746618403116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20470500123190097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1655364926857638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2006146175527886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19995683322367128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20400545206219498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.193122823125603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22141913141420375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15188307508015567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

125,17757,9062,Borodino '41,1995,5.51887,300,3.125,"Borodino '41: Battle for the Moscow Highway October 11-18, 1941, is a simulation game depicting the little known but crucial battle for the Moscow Highway that took place near and on the old Napoleonic battlefield of Borodino, October 11-18, 1941.  The motorized division SS Das Reich and the 10th Panzer Division were ordered to detach themselves from the outer encirclement line around the forces of the Soviet Western Reserve Fronts and head for Dorochova.  That would halfway to Moscow. Resistance was not expected to be significant.  But already rushing in to block them were all the forces that Stavka could scrape together.  Several tank brigades rolled out of Moscow to slow the German advance.  Cadet schools marched off to throw themselves in the way of the oncoming panzers while from far across Siberia, trains rushed at full steam, all other traffic shunted out of their way, bearing Stavka's ace card, the veteran 32nd Rifle Division from Vladivostok.  Despite subsequent German claims that only mud preserved Moscow from their iron clutches, an examination of the fight for the one all-weather road from Warsaw to Moscow shows a much clearer picture of what really happened.  Here is a clash of titans, two crack German divisions facing one of the best rifle divisions in the Soviet Army.  If your experience from other wargames would lead you to believe tat the panzers will romp, you, like the Germans at Borodino, are in for a big eye-opening experience.&#10;&#10;Based on the award winning Black Sea Black Death game system, Borodino '41 uses a map scale of 800 meters (one half mile) per hex, three or four impulses per daily turn, with infantry battalions and tanks and anti-tank guns by company (battery).&#10;&#10;The units are played mostly face down, with dummies, to recreate the Fog of War. Combat involves fire, and assault, which are influenced by troop morale, terrain effects, armor support, engineers, and various other specialized units.&#10;&#10;Included are some of the best troops of both sides, as well as Soviet reserve infantry, and tanks ranging from Pzkpfw IIIs and IVs, BT-7s, T-26s, T-34s, a few KV-1s, amphibious T-38s-even a T-28 Co without engines!&#10;&#10;The game uses an updated version of the Black Sea Black Death system, with relatively little chrome and a high level of excitement. The impulse based game system keeps both players actively involved.

The basic game is played as follows:&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the first player places the neutral Moeraki-ball on one of the nine central intersections of the board. After that, the players take turns placing one of their own pieces on the board. When a square is on the board is completely enclosed by pieces, the player who has the majority (normally 3:1, but it can be 2:1 or 3:0 next to the edge or the neutral Moeraki-ball) claims the field and places a tribe marker on it.&#10;&#10;The game can be won in one of four ways:&#10;1. Tahuna (beach): A player wins if he has enclosed a field with four of his own pieces.&#10;2. Awa (river): A player wins if he has a piece on each of the intersections on one of the diagonal lines from one edge to another edge.&#10;3. Ara (road): A player wins if he has a piece on each of the four intersections on one edge.&#10;4. Marae (holy ground): When all the fields in the center have been claimed, players count the number of tribal markers they have got on the board (markers that are on the edge and that have been claimed with a 2:1 majority count only half). The player with the most markers wins the game.&#10;&#10;The players win several matches, until one of them has won the pre-determined amount of matches.&#10;&#10;In the advanced version of the game, both players receive a Maori-Tane (warrior). Once during the game, a player may place the Tane on the board instead of a tribal marker. When he does so, all he chooses a direction. Any fields between the Tane and the edge in that direction cannot be claimed; any markers already present are removed.&#10;&#10;",2,2,25,25,"['Pattern Building', 'Tile Placement']",8,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Abstract Strategy'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1870,19,112,145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15913125409171452,0.0,0.0,0.11668489235745039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16009664481638392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.319575408305343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14615281520880272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10178115200600334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12134801740376079,0.10131226447035721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5931754048382067,0.10131226447035721,0.0,0.30110560081013615,0.14615281520880272,0.0,0.2141159290728146,0.11249809588241012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14217933678773007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11011904032277667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11985595432712438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13630830802302474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15461822395495092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11219305943779771,0.0,0.0,0.37704690963492765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

131,11378,388677,Keops,2023,5.55735,180,4.25,"The Pyramid of Keops (also known as Giza) was the first wonder of the Ancient World. Built around 2600 BC, it was the tallest building on Earth for nearly 4,000 years. For its construction were used about 2 million blocks of granite stone, covered by limestone, assembled by complex systems of wooden cranes and transported on barges from the Upper Nile. Various theories suggest that the Egyptians had access to advanced technology, or even that they were assisted by otherworldly beings.&#10;&#10;Be that as it may, the construction of The Pyramids was the most important engineering work of mankind to date, with an unprecedented waste of resources and manpower.&#10;&#10;In Keops, you will become one of the Viziers of Pharaoh Khufu, who has decreed the construction of the largest pyramid to date. The eternal glory of all Mizraim is at stake. You will have to compete with the rest of the Viziers to obtain the Pharaoh's favor and make Mizraim the envy of the people who want to destroy it. Keep Ra and the other gods of the Pantheon happy, making offerings in their temples.&#10;&#10;Construct buildings to obtain better rents when you recover your officials, besides obtaining prestige constructing a city worthy of the Pharaoh's relatives and assistants. Reinforce the borders with your Medjay to avoid the invasion of the fearsome enemies of Egypt.  Acquire the best barges in the port, fill your warehouses with granite and limestone, and send your craftsmen to prepare the tomb for Jufu's journey to the afterlife, building the first Wonder of the ancient world. The game is played over three rounds, marked by the construction of the three levels of the Pyramid. During the round, players will take turns until the current level of the Pyramid is built. To do so, they will have to wisely manage their craftsmen, scribes and priests, without forgetting their needs and happiness.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, the Pharaoh Jufu will grant his Favor to the Viziers (players) who have contributed the most to the defense of the Frontiers, the welfare of the Gods, the construction of the city and the Pyramid. Keops is an action building game, with worker placement and resource management mechanics. The actions available at the start of the game are related to obtaining materials to build the Pyramid and defending the borders. However, as players build the city, and new temples and crops, the available actions will increase, increasing the possibilities and strategies. Each game of Keops is conditioned to what the players build, so each one will be a different experience. This, added to the different families available and the use of the Decree cards, which modify the rules of the game, make each game completely different. This is one of the strong points of Keops.&#10;&#10;The game is played over three rounds, the end of each round being determined by the level of construction of the pyramid. During a round, players will play their turns one at a time, assigning their officials to the various actions or removing them from the central board to obtain their rents and pay their salaries. Each of the buildings that have been constructed are available to all players, regardless of who built them. However, you will receive benefits every time another player makes use of one of your buildings. This is important when it comes to developing your long-term strategy, as it provides extra income, which always comes in handy. In Keops there are no victory points. To win the game you will have to win the favor of the Pharaoh Jufu. Be the player with more offerings in the temple of Ra, to obtain the favor of the priests of the Pharaoh. Build the Pyramid to earn the favor of the architects' guild of Jufu. Defend the Borders hiring Medjays to avoid the invasion of your territories and not to lose resources, workers or your own buildings. And build the city to obtain Prestige, thus gaining the Favor of the Pharaoh's court.

All this under the watchful eye of Jufu, who will not stop in the construction of his great tomb.

Only those who choose wisely and collect the right combination of crew mates will have a chance to outmaneuver their enemies. You should not shy away from stealing your rival captain's crew or treasure points and gaining the upper hand while hiring crew members. Only the captain who is clever and combines cards with foresight will set sail as one of the most infamous of pirates. Once you have hired your crew it's time to say &quot;All Hands On Deck&quot; and you are ready to gather valuable treasure points.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;Each player has got a deck of cards in front of him or her, but during the game players can draw from any deck. At the beginning of a turn players each draw 3 cards without looking at them. Then a player counts down from 3 and all players start looking at their hand, then putting one card aside and the rest on the deck in front of them. The first player to do so is going to be the next first player and will start drawing cards at the beginning of the next turn. The card you have put aside is your hidden crew. As soon as you have got a combination of 2 or more cards in your hidden crew you can shout &quot;All Hands On Deck&quot; and play one set of cards for an effect and the treasure points they are worth.

145,25772,348303,Free at Last,2022,5.47592,180,3.0,"Free at Last is a game for 2-6 players.  Players take on the role of civil rights organizations (SNCC, CORE, etc) as they fight for equal rights and the end of segregation in the Deep South, circa 1960-1964.  It is not about Washington, DC, but the efforts of the people on the spot, whether that is Claiborne Parish, Louisiana or Mobile, Alabama.&#10;&#10;Free at Last is a card-driven game in which each card has a number (used to activate special individuals) and an event, but uniquely, the color of the number also matters and affects the type of project (voting rights, accommodations, school desegregation) that can be attempted. Multiple-length versions can be played: 3 turns (ending with the Freedom Rides), 6 turns (ending with the March on Washington), or a 9 turn game covering this entire period in American history. Players take turns playing cards from their hand.  These cards let the players take actions to accomplish Projects--examples include working to desegregate schools in New Orleans; Fayette County voter registration; as well as the various Freedom Rides across the south.  They also can be used for a specific event on the card, granting special powers to the players--but also potentially creating future disadvantageous consequences or making cooperation between the players' groups more difficult.&#10;&#10;While the game will eventually mean one organization/player 'wins', players must work together; if projects fail and are suppressed by the segregationists, then the Civil Rights Movement falls apart.  Thus, Free at Last is cooperative AND competitive.&#10;&#10;Note: This game bears the same name and designer as Free at Last, but the designs each stand on their own, with this game being for 2-6 players while the previous game was for only two players.&#10;&#10;",2,6,60,180,"['Hand Management', 'Semi-Cooperative Game', 'Set Collection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Worker Placement']",12,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Political']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1803,11,83,173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10962058372478711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14224308611077321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15503047360208747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0917474720409274,0.0,0.0,0.15941210865939487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10438259217469886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5358136595697843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15941210865939487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1613027555568538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2053895386427955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14608462176878392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10851887507954706,0.11403324233386232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.150317465722054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12704468521475382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23655434347628385,0.16431035991572082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14224308611077321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36447451784146145,0.15260724048678834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24678157786007607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12704468521475382,0.0,0.16431035991572082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12262063600872544,0.16228131998134113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09554802079178193,0.0,0.139866035198128,0.0,0.0

Depending on the role you secretly got will help determine if you should lie about your role, though you never have to. After that, players continue discussing until 2 players vote to begin combat. Once combat begins, players may attack each other at any point in time, until someone dies. Every time someone dies, combat is paused and a vote to end the game goes up. All living players must unanimously vote to end and to not vote yes, you have to attack another player, if you cannot then you're forced to vote yes to end.

The aim of the game is to produce a line of 5  (but no more) pieces of his colour in any direction.&#10;&#10;",2,2,30,30,['Pattern Building'],0,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Abstract Strategy'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,719,6,35,72,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23596477625763307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22862081208818638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22383077938659135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2581364477970034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.481112880054455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18248997672245493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21681874970779585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4533264756077184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22200730292602092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15960201357954484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25221675000596866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23822101698522336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2508155882024856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The actions of the handful of Americans represented by the game were critical in setting the stage for the more famous siege of Bastogne itself.

157,16607,242409,Cartooner: The Fast & Furious Game of Drawing Comics,2018,5.52354,0,1.0,"Cartooner is a new experience in drawing games, a game that combines storytelling and drawing. It is like Once Upon a Time plus Pictionary, with story prompts that are inspired by popular and quirky comics themes and trends. While this is a game about drawing, it's not a game in which the best artist wins as your strategy and ability to adapt quickly matters much more. Points are awarded for strategy and following the rules, not artistic ability. However, if you are an artist, it is undeniable that Cartooner can be a great companion for you as well. A solo mode has been designed just for that.&#10;&#10;The game plays out in four rounds that build up in intensity, and each round is five minutes long. Your goal is to get the most fame points at each round using a combination of your theme cards and the fleeting market trends that are valid only for one round. In the end, the player with the most fame wins&hellip;but every player walks away with a comic of their own creation.&#10;&#10;Start by drawing three theme cards at random to determine what your comic will be about. Will your comic involve Dinosaurs, Secret Hideouts and Car Chases? Werewolves, Obnoxious Coworkers and The Desire to Be Famous? Or Pirates, Blobs and The Last Human on Earth? When time is up, follow these simple rules to score the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Rule 1: You get 1 Fame point for each Theme you express in your comic in a way the other players can recognize by drawing it or writing it in a word balloon. &#10;    Rule 2: You get 2 Fame for drawing something in every Panel, no matter how simple. &#10;    Rule 3: You get 2 more Fame for keeping it succinct by using three or fewer Word Balloons on the page. It's that easy.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rounds two through four introduce an element of strategy: Trend Cards. Each Trend Card gives you new ways to earn Fame points for that round. Unlike Themes, which are personal, Trend Cards represent the market and affect every player in the game. Your fickle readers may want you to inject Superheroes, Funny Animals, Medical drama, Disaster stories, Mystery,  Romance, or any one of 52 Trends into your story. It's every artist's dilemma: stick to your original story, or sell out for Fame?&#10;&#10;Each round brings more Panels to draw and Trends to chase.

162,13473,13779,Suleiman the Magnificent,2004,5.53945,120,2.8235,"Suleiman the Magnificent is a game covering the massive battle on August 29th, 1526 between the Ottoman Empire and the army of the Kingdom of Hungary that eventually resulted in the fall of the latter kingdom and the disappearance of Hungary as an independent country for 400 years. The Hungarians numbered around 35,000 (including artillerist), the Ottomans, about 60,000. While there is much disagreement about numbers at this battle, all sources agree that the Ottomans did outnumber the Hungarians significantly. The Hungarian front line was stretched rather thinly to match, or attempt to match, the frontage that would be presented by the Ottomans. The Hungarians had, as was the practice for the last 200 years in European warfare, dug a trench in front of their front line infantry and artillery to give them a defense advantage. The actual battle, which started at around 3:00 PM, lasted but a few hours, maybe less.&#10;&#10;Each combat unit represents about 750 men. The map scale is about 225 yards per hex and depicts the flat and, because of the proximity of the oft-overflowing Danube, somewhat soft and, in many places, slippery battlefield at Mohacs.&#10;&#10;Suleiman the Magnificent is an accessible, fast-playing, fun game of low complexity. Optional rules include the politically charged issue that has reverberated down over the centuries, that many of the contingents of allies called in by Hungarian King Lajos did not arrive in time for the battle. Some were never going to do so; some were held back - specifically the charge leveled at Johann Szapolyai, Voivode of Transylvania because of his ambitions for the Hungarian throne (which he did get after Lajos' death and some deals reached with Suleiman).&#10;&#10;Full color 22&quot;x34&quot; map &#10;240 full color die cut counters &#10;Rulebook length - 12 pages&#10;Charts and tables - 2 pages &#10;Complexity - Low &#10;Solitaire suitability - Medium &#10;Playing time - 2 hours&#10;&#10;Design - Richard Berg&#10;Development - Paul Rohrbaugh &#10;Graphic Design - Craig Grando&#10;&#10;",2,2,120,120,"['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Movement Points', 'Simulation']",0,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Pike and Shot', 'Renaissance', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2068,11,108,206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20736416297565918,0.1337011403571073,0.0,0.0,0.10581106679302531,0.0,0.48992597074582417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13129642339536532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23294535846718212,0.0,0.1297827220367565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12073481887845497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1243226261209876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39388927018609593,0.26415855590811543,0.13129642339536532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0856735250061677,0.0,0.12248149268645604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12495914322400922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10968486097708725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26415855590811543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1626084904816834,0.2525380458538184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12248149268645604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13207927795405772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12495914322400922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18674731573209824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09656843730836377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.158458657949041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

There are a variety of ethnic dishes represented (English, Chinese, Italian, French or Indian), a few of which are also vegetarian. Players get bonuses for specializing in a certain ethnic cuisine and must be mindful to prepare at least one&#10;vegetarian dish lest they be penalized by the growing veggie-lover contingent.&#10;&#10;A number of recipes are played face-up to the table (onto a well designed board), with each recipe listing the ingredients it requires.&#10; Players begin the game with only one ingredient and must acquire new ingredients either through auction (the most common method) or random draw (costly and a crap-shoot). When a player acquires new ingredients, whether it is on his turn or not, he immediately has the opportunity to&#10;prepare one of the dishes depicted on the face-up recipe cards. If he can supply all of the necessary ingredients, he takes the corresponding recipe card and acquires money (beans ... actual beans!) to increase his coffers. Players may also cook recipes which were previously cooked by other players, but they only receive a portion of the monetary amount the original cook received.&#10;&#10;",2,5,90,90,['Auction / Bidding'],12,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Card Game'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1253,12,56,126,0.0,0.0,0.21506993447984915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2007915865632161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17296434280427636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17511754170809202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3459286856085527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14895819541095148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23392444761627026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2129551938069631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14688056313441306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2042753233583207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14620391069017322,0.0,0.22695093286035667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20338498410772454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15449554076774488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22828147075164557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1859121528296205,0.1674175583969353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45928519676998314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17457185632975064,0.2310357554724238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

During this time period, Japan didn&rsquo;t have a ruler so it was split into different regions ruled by different warlords called daimyos. Each player plays as a samurai to propose policies to their daimyo in order to win his trust. In each round, players can discuss what kind of policy they will propose. They may form alliances and gain the daimyo&rsquo;s trust together and or deceive each other and become the lone winner.

The goal is to build and strengthen your army before the Final War card is turned over in the Fate deck and all-out battle commences between the players.&#10;&#10;Choose your champion and join the Final War!&#10;&#10;",2,4,0,0,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Player Elimination', 'Take That']",0,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Fantasy']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1034,8,60,109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278125915632471,0.0,0.13593762263668982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13725360339871093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20324919478380912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1069841917141758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14543541124240303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1446147417580143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12833894004946525,0.0,0.47665465861140044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14627411885534553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44672059017181986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14800894760404046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10435144717891469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11982385794547791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09577987407979201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14800894760404046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19110948537575853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14149793584503867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12678118660805376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09444858812945987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0862400109684687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43143405244808547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14890686339060663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10668253275000952,0.0

The dice depict curves or straights in three different colors, and after the player stops rolling, she chooses all the dice of one color and must use all of them to move on the track. Colored track on the player board can be moved through only with dice of the appropriate color, while any die color can be used to cross gray track; if a player can't use all movement for a color, she must choose a different color. A player cannot cross the same square twice. End your movement in a tight corner, and you take another turn immediately.&#10;&#10;Players take turns until one reaches the finish line, which triggers the final round. After all players have taken the same number of turns, whoever has driven the farthest across the finish line wins. Variants in the rulebook include an option for oil slicks that take two dice to cross, a point system for a multi-race world championship, and a two lap race on the Indianapolis board that includes a shortcut.

185,20887,313696,KAWA: A Game About Flow,2020,5.50739,60,2.0,"Kawa is a game of quiet contemplation for 2 to 4 players, named after the word for river (&#229;&#183;&#157;) in Japanese.&#10;&#10;In Kawa, you guide petals down a river made up of 16 unique tiles. Each round, players will follow the currents and eddies printed on the tiles to send their petals downstream, leaving petals behind as they do.&#10;&#10;As the river comes alive with colour, players must carefully avoid flowing into other players' petals&mdash;when that occurs, those players gain points. This is made all the more challenging as when each player flows, they swap two adjacent river tiles, changing up the river's paths.&#10;&#10;Between each round, the river flows forward, washing away the furthest row of tiles and shuffling them back to the start. Hence, simply following the river's currents is easy - but mastering the game will require players to learn to read its constantly changing flow. After four rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Flora and fauna, represented as special tiles, breathe life into the river. Every game, players replace two river tiles with special tiles, each with their own unique effects. These range from a Crab that shuffles up the board by scuttling across the river, to a Shrine that rewards players for spreading their petals across as much as the river as possible. With nine different special tiles of varying complexity to choose from, both casual and hardcore players will find something new to love each foray down the river.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,60,"['Modular Board', 'Network and Route Building', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Programmed Movement', 'Square Grid', 'Tile Placement', 'Turn Order: Progressive', 'Variable Set-up', 'Zone of Control']",12,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Abstract Strategy', 'Animals', 'Environmental', 'Territory Building']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1559,12,85,143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12478264048601619,0.10056164490724424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12786719023528353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09073348683156612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1193762228712372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09987303856760268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07211281763816724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09397251552327089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10503264257818627,0.0,0.08402965375014411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1034726646054058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12064553367488286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2466880715622116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16208030080794777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1164050297247028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09483558739051072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0978909941598771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16094802900803276,0.09919877924226818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2761317599247487,0.0,0.08686461400790808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7681869111353251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18355510810313982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07435597461690344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
186,10801,318702,Tumbleweed,2020,5.56453,200,2.3333,"Tumbleweed is a two-player game. It is played on a hexhex board and a sufficient supply of stacked checkers.&#10;&#10;A stack can &quot;see&quot; a hex, when they are connected by a straight line, with no stacks in between. The players take turns placing stacks of their tokens on hexes that are seen by at least one friendly stack. The height of every newly-placed stack equals the number of your stacks that see the new stack. Replacing an existing stack with a new stack is possible, as long as the new stack is taller than the previous one. This works with opponent stacks (to capture), or your own stacks (to reinforce).&#10;&#10;Before the game, the host sets up the board and the guest decides which side he wants to play. Setup consists of one stack of two neutral tokens in the central hex, and a single starting token for each player in hexes of the host's choosing.&#10;&#10;The game ends when no more moves can be made by either player, or after two successive passes.

Two peoples -- historically, ethnically, and culturally homogeneous, but polarized by politics and economics -- hurl men, weapons, and materials into the fray in an attempt to settle their division once and for all.&#10;&#10;From Pyongyang in North Korea to Pusan in South Korea, the battle rages. While the front line surges east to west across the peninsula, both sides commit airborne and seaborne Special Forces and Marines as well as their Air Forces to deep penetrations into enemy territory. With skilled infiltration capabilities, and the strategic mobility of armor, airmobile, paratroop, and marine forces, there is no safe haven throughout the length or breadth of Korea.&#10;&#10;While the North and South battle for a quick, decisive victory, the world awaits the response of the two military superpowers in the region, the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. Will the United States reinforce the South, and if so, how, when, and in what strength? Will the Communist Chinese again intervene into the Korean conflict as they did in 1950? As the situation evolves, choices are made, forces are committed, and the security of Japan and the future of the two Koreas hangs in the balance.&#10;&#10;Crisis: Korea 1995 allows players to fight a near-future war on the peninsula. Players have access to virtually all available military assets of North and South Korea, as well as large forces from the USA and the PRC. The integrated, easy-to-learn air-land combat system allows for unit efficiency, armor effects, tunnels, light infantry, attack helicopter, Close Air Support, Cruise Missiles, and particularly tough terrain of Korea.&#10;&#10;",2,4,360,360,['Hexagon Grid'],12,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Modern Warfare', 'Political', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1784,12,78,174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41005513647319286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21477817120377768,0.17238030709463878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39350974771409275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20848360469066873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21091522201780843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20283918111314592,0.21612891594717037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2121728034414627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20848360469066873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19215532700210972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1555782418234244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2017769655495949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2096859032569809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14530425495371152,0.0,0.20615549237583716,0.0,0.0,0.32258300872704443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15293083572460497,0.0

192,23379,7488,Squeeky,2003,5.49668,30,1.25,"Squeeky is a racing game for children. Every player gets 7 mice with hidden numbers 1-7. The board shows a starting area for every player and a table with a large piece of cheese on it. All paths go to a common path on the table which leads to the middle, the goal. In their turn, a player throws two dice. For each die they can move one of their mice towards the cheese. If they manage to outstrip other mice or land on the same space on the table, they catch these mice and the mice's points count for them at the end.

194,9900,202435,To Take Washington: Jubal Early's Summer 1864 Campaign,2019,5.57647,3600,4.3,"To Take Washington: Jubal Early&rsquo;s Summer 1864 Campaign is the third game in the Series: Line of Battle (MMP) series and covers Jubal Early&rsquo;s campaign during the summer of 1864. From June into July, Old Jube swept out of the Shenandoah Valley and across the Potomac River to advance on Washington DC. By threatening the Federal capital, Early and the Confederate command hoped to divert forces from Grant&rsquo;s Overland Campaign, relieving the pressure on Richmond.&#10;&#10;Historically, Early narrowly defeated Lew Wallace on the Monocacy River, outside of Frederick, MD. However, this &lsquo;victory&rsquo; cost him precious time and manpower. Though he went on to test the outer forts protecting Washington itself (mainly at Fort Stevens), Early was too weak and too late to take advantage of the once-denuded nature of the fortress garrisons.&#10;&#10;As Abraham Lincoln quipped, &ldquo;Mr. Early, you are late.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;In To Take Washington, players first fight the Battle of Monocacy. Their relative success or failure there, as well as their raw efficiency, determines when the Confederates show up on the separate Fort Stevens map. An arrival mere hours earlier than their historical appearance makes an enormous difference in the strength of Union forces manning the defenses, since they had been stripped bare prior to Early&rsquo;s advance. Conversely, a mediocre showing at Monocacy will present the Confederate player with a very difficult problem at Fort Stevens. Jubal Early couldn&rsquo;t solve it &ndash; can you?&#10;&#10;To Take Washington covers these two related actions on two separate map areas. One (with two map sheets) covers the Monocacy battlefield while the other (with one map sheet) shows the area around Fort Stevens and a portion of Washington itself.&#10;&#10;The Series: Line of Battle (MMP) series premiered with None But Heroes, covering the Battle of Antietam, and went on to set a new standard of excellence with its presentation of Gettysburg in Last Chance for Victory: The Battle of Gettysburg. The LoB series rules are the pinnacle of over 30 years of development starting with the Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series and its follow-on Series: Civil War Regimental Sub-Series (MMP). The LoB system and battle-specific rules incorporate fresh research while discarding the mistaken assumptions and false impressions that have crept into ACW games of the past forty years. Above all, Line of Battle is designed to capture the free-for-all nature of an American Civil War battle in a fun, fast, and very playable format.&#10;&#10;Scenarios: To Take Washington includes twelve scenarios, with one entry point for the full two-battle Campaign Game. Ten of the scenarios use only one map (either a portion of the Monocacy map set, or the single Fort Stevens map).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 15-30 minutes&#10;Hex: 110 yards / 100 meters&#10;Units: Batteries to Regiments&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Three 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheet (840 1/2&quot; counters - 267 playing pieces, rest markers)&#10;One 36-page Line of Battle Series v2.0 rulebook&#10;One 20-page To Take Washington rulebook&#10;Two 6-page dual-side printed LoB Charts &amp; Tables v2.0 booklet&#10;One single-side printed Terrain Key&#10;One Single-side printed Turn Record Track chart&#10;Two 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;",1,6,120,3600,"['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Line of Sight', 'Movement Points', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Simulation']",14,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['American Civil War', 'Civil War', 'Post-Napoleonic', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3557,23,235,307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03976271765400963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057167648863590985,0.0,0.045929821425165704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.54257717498052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05159589083613629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04655196708500195,0.0,0.0,0.05348396358668863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044617264022044814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05507331580254651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11701882453250669,0.058162617819550046,0.0,0.0,0.04125116719230429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05507331580254651,0.0,0.05052559141625928,0.0,0.04736756538949646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048588975119226274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058864367326653635,0.0,0.0,0.23403764906501337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3915488109361207,0.0,0.03777374222589406,0.0,0.05749206769078845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04518657287111636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058162617819550046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05452471374334411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08272664611012007,0.0,0.04770656603904835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04562811348694607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29486586002027465,0.08555713807503161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4309107003422,0.07467293660672272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20550267797438512,0.0,0.0,0.058864367326653635,0.16692787395485417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059600361783880805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05564262465161806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05922787633911247,0.07235103830353519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07019513650220428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05507331580254651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03409153593267357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08013907927151516,0.0,0.1705501812492875,0.0,0.0,0.04447823175628236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Players play cards by matching the set of the previously played card (Aeroplane, Train, Ship, Motor or Animal), or by playing a card bearing the same number in the top corner (the Animal suit has 2 numbers per card). When a player is unable to do either of these, he draws a card from the draw deck.&#10;&#10;'Lightning' cards act as wild cards, allowing the player to call the next set to be played.  There is one 'Extra Turn' card that can be played in addition to a normal card (hence the only chance to get rid of 2 cards in a turn).&#10;&#10;When the first person has finished, the others score penalty points equal to the sum of the numbers on the cards they have left in their hand.&#10;&#10;",2,5,30,30,['Hand Management'],7,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Animals', 'Card Game', 'Transportation']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1088,9,56,110,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20938289377331637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13802649790377447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16140639242511634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16341570868998298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21559731449511962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.278008802896949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18210824593985592,0.0,0.4160295200117656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19872494540373883,0.20274490757929162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16341570868998298,0.1364341655646803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1949777396372983,0.0,0.0,0.21429725197403474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.432515178737857,0.15149778676423561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1482939845216594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27349796369227286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19407934410446262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The player with the most points at the end will become valedictorian and win the game.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from designer&#10;&#10;",1,4,45,150,"['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Multiple Maps', 'Storytelling', 'Worker Placement']",14,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Medieval', 'Novel-based', 'Renaissance']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,934,7,55,101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22169081750753847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1760910188268764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18490891758057748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15402068562084836,0.16123281122240882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20602498191878676,0.2004237499569759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2889642043671114,0.2270746274182566,0.17847627223522639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12759113628225957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18769664745586775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18490891758057748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19954076795880551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1451625123547426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2144521075812277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16692601383303593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17324146724877162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14281529524995099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2285027048510049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4541492548365132,0.1790882800359606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15815345745521747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
214,10638,251131,Point Blank: V is for Victory,2022,5.5661,90,3.3333,"&quot;Point Blank&quot; is Lock 'n Load Publishing tactical World War 2 squad card wargame for 1-2 players pitted against each other in situational combat scenarios.&#10;&#10;There is also a solo option as well as partnerships in teams of 2.&#10;&#10;Each scenario presents the players with a unique situation involving squads of men, support weapons, leaders, and individual armored fighting vehicles.&#10;&#10;This game pits the forces of the USA against Germany just after the landings in Normandy (June 1944) through October 1944. Each player has victory conditions determined by the scenario in which to defend or take objectives, seek and destroy their opponent&rsquo;s units, or one of many other different scenario objectives.&#10;&#10;The game is played on an abstract map board made up of terrain cards in the game and managed through a distance system that accounts for the range to targets, line of sight, and defensive attributes. The player has units that start out on the map and gradually work their way towards their objectives by advancing through the battlefield, all the while conducting combat actions against their opponent or defending their troops from return fire or whatever hell awaits them. Players draw cards from a common action deck where they will play actions on their units on the map board. The game is an IGOUGO impulse system, and turns are managed when the action deck is exhausted. (Some scenarios may require multiple deck exhaustion to finish the game). Actions in the game consist of Fire, Move, Assault, Rally, etc. The action cards contain dice icons on them to determine random results.&#10;&#10;One of the unique features of the game is that it contains a deck of terrain cards that are not part of the action deck. As players change terrain, they will draw a terrain card in which their moving units will occupy. Some action cards, such as Recon, help players manage what terrain they occupy, but your opponent may have other plans for your moving troops during their turn.&#10; Combat in the game is similar to how combat is conducted in Lock n Load Tactical. 2 players can play a game in about an hour (depending on the scenario size), and if you cannot find an opponent, then try the game solo system. In general, the gameplay is fast and exciting and compares to such legendary game systems as Up Front.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher.&#10;&#10;",1,4,60,90,"['Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Line of Sight', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Team-Based Game']",14,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,"['Card Game', 'Wargame', 'World War II']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2402,19,99,206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34458715609085744,0.1965791367073325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09700465825453981,0.0,0.0,0.09821752936898447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3789727899558382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0942085763099194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31051437933216197,0.0,0.07671462148056549,0.09584822059609832,0.0719651933554998,0.0,0.055391400805978666,0.0,0.14524459151044739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09528956951988167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09075725130492249,0.09122191766921402,0.0,0.08067782390574858,0.0,0.0,0.09584822059609832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09317263780498325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07697768136067437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09641971534436164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09474319748895955,0.0,0.0,0.059353233178159485,0.27653444437343455,0.1233410716185767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07174996320846226,0.18737042230805057,0.0,0.09641971534436164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34157987082358254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08292467466403593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06486782577605926,0.0,0.0,0.0786173256468533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07519217069027119,0.0,0.0,0.09584822059609832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08098663441973944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09474319748895955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06672257176957191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2750863060548937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07697768136067437,0.0,0.07262229575522369,0.0,0.0,0.14099261263013613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06603200162186079,0.0,0.09368521115402528,0.07352635635567746,0.0,0.07329724020206622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08360578375485136,0.06949782162825575,0.0

220,9114,287258,Secret Night at Davis Manor,2019,5.59014,120,2.6667,"Secret Night at Davis Manor is a team-based board game set in 1928 York, England. It takes place in Davis Manor. Players secretly take on the role of police and thieves, and they must co-operate to achieve their objectives: The thieves have to take the money and escape with it in a vehicle, while the police have to arrest the thieves.&#10;&#10;Script: England, 1928, following a period of scarcity in the wake of the first world war, Europe is experiencing a period of artistic and economic splendor.&#10;&#10;In celebration of this new era of prosperity a grand dinner has been organised at the Davis Manor. The greatest Luminaries and elites of the time are set to attend, however all is not what it seems!&#10;&#10;The police have received warning that a master thief is planning to attend the event and steal the Davis Manor fortune. This thief is rumoured to never act alone, pulling off heists using hidden accomplices.&#10; Instead of cancelling the event a daring plan has been hatched! The chief inspector himself will attend the party, along with hidden detective agents. Using their skills, cunning and powers of deduction they will attempt to catch a thief! But be careful.. Not everyone is as they seem in Davis Manor and a lot can happen in the Secret Night.&#10;&#10;How to play resume:&#10;&#10;Roles: The Master Thief and the Chief Inspector reveal their roles and keep them shown.The rest of the players will keep their roles hidden.&#10;&#10;Characters: Each character has a special skill.&#10;&#10;The mansion: There are 16 rooms in the mansion.They are represented by their names on the perimeter of the Main Board. At the beginning of the game the object cards are shuffled (green circle at the back) and 16 of them are randomly placed face up in each room held by the Main Board. The rest of the object cards are stacked face down as a draw deck.&#10;&#10;Mechanics: Draw one card, spin the roulette to move the pawn around the board by the number rolled, and perform actions with object cards and/or the Action Square.&#10;&#10;During their movement, the player can do as many actions as they wants/are able to.&#10;&#10;The most common action is to perform a search. Being on a green search hex gives you the opportunity to take the card stored in the associated room slot on the edge of the Main Board.&#10;&#10;Once checked, you should keep one of the cards in your hand (at your choice) in the slot of the room hidden face down.&#10;&#10;Inventory: The maximum number of cards at the end of your turn is 3, and 1 must always be shown face up next to the player board (even if you only have 1 card in total).&#10;&#10;Action square: Once per turn, when you are next to another pawn, you may use the Action Square to perform an action:&#10;&#10;-To Trade cards with another player, either, 1 for 1 , 2 for 2 or 3 for 3.&#10;&#10;-To Steal a card: The target victim shuffles all his cards (shown and hidden) before he is robbed. The player performing the action then chooses 1 card blindly.&#10;&#10;-Push: Move a player up to 2 squares. If he encounters an obstacle: (wall, other player) stops.&#10;&#10;-Whisper a secret: Use it to have a private conversation (whispering to the ear) with another player. This can be useful for plotting strategies or bluffing.&#10;&#10;In addition to these actions, players may use the object cards.&#10;&#10;End of the game: The game ends at dawn (9 turns - 6:00 am) or when a team's score counter reaches 10 points. If the game ends in a tie and the Deceiver (the role for games with odd players) is not in play, the first team to score wins.&#10;&#10;",4,8,60,120,"['Open Drafting', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers']",12,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Murder / Mystery', 'Spies / Secret Agents']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3617,37,225,274,0.0,0.08788832271042846,0.0,0.39633624588066213,0.18841734639045063,0.0,0.0902971202990087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07884629702296228,0.0,0.08570084202276008,0.0,0.2032964073008231,0.07254681087963254,0.09355127910907947,0.0,0.0,0.07403647131164923,0.07429406091497011,0.0,0.0,0.09297711141668248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0848791465874618,0.08257152454896391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0595244198848508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13921416569606226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07047360765919286,0.0,0.1051311997108365,0.13360137855754642,0.0,0.0,0.07230734347457742,0.0,0.0,0.07980589541435873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27842833139212453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0651568094977283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05980473848564329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07980589541435873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0848791465874618,0.0,0.23198445797697204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05688893990704621,0.0,0.11822006040206551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08220774944868826,0.0,0.137541937540177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14094721531838572,0.11767544176007382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09241645481409619,0.0,0.05883772088003691,0.07617965051848674,0.0,0.0,0.09297711141668248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08612256641688468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09413962520489552,0.0,0.14557741893481857,0.27893133425004746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1279046202739805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25585935701682616,0.0,0.0,0.11794697305020403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06776546910027438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06737485697117018,0.0,0.2384451485370616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0554371118206131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902971202990087,0.0,0.09297711141668248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06960708284803113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16154420808712802,0.0,0.1465600024569016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08979548479730434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05474307810549266,0.0,0.0,0.0666123340983437,0.0

227,13428,151224,Veletas,2013,5.53971,45,2.0,"Veletas is a drawless territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the spaces (squares) of a 10x10 checkered square board, which is initially empty. Apart from the board, the necessary material comprises seven shooters and a sufficient number of black and white stones.&#10;&#10;Both players control a number of neutral red pieces and shoot stones of their own colour from them. In order to win, a player must claim a majority of neutral pieces by having them surrounded by larger groups of their own pieces than their opponent's.&#10;&#10;This game won (along with Four) the BoardGameGeek Best Combinatorial 2-Player Game of 2013 Award.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsA group is a set of one or more like-colored, orthogonally adjacent stones. The size of a group is the number of stones in it. Stones on top of shooters are not part of any groups.&#10;&#10;A trapped shooter is a shooter that cannot make any legal move in the current position.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayThe first player begins by placing three shooters and one black stone on empty squares of the board. The second player then chooses which player will be Black and which will be White. Next, White places the remaining four shooters and one white stone on empty squares of the board. In both cases, no shooters can be placed on the perimeter of the board. This restriction does not apply to the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;From then on, the players take turns, starting with Black. On your turn, you may (but are not obliged to) move a shooter to an empty square in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, without jumping over any stones. Then, you must place a stone of your color on an empty square that is a straight orthogonal or diagonal line away from the square onto which the shooter was moved (or from any shooter, if none was moved), with no stones in between along that line. This is called shooting. Claimed shooters (see below) cannot move or shoot. Note shooters can move and shoot over claimed or unclaimed shooters.&#10;&#10;After shooting, if there are any trapped shooters on the board that have not been claimed before, each one of them is claimed by the player who owns the biggest group orthogonally adjacent to it. If there is no such group or the biggest such groups of each color are the same size, the shooter is claimed by the opponent. Claiming a shooter is indicated by placing a stone of the corresponding color on top of it. Claimed shooters remain unchanged for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has claimed the majority of shooters, i.e. at least four of them. That player wins. Draws are not possible.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Smaller versionsFor shorter but still reasonable games, the following variants are suggested:&#10;&#10;&#10;     7x7 board with three shooters. The first player places one shooter, and White places the other two. Whoever claims two shooters wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     9x9 board with five shooters. The first player places two shooters, and White places the other three.

In Bright Got 'Em you outsmart and corner your opponents through savvy card play, sly movement, and clever placement of blocking walls. In the still-casual, but even-trickier Brainy Got 'Em! you toss aside card actions in favor of a purely strategic challenge.&#10;&#10;Both games share the same goal, the same exciting intrigue, and the same social fun. &#10;Place walls to trap your opponents' pawns before they trap yours!&#10;&#10;Surround yourself with friends and family. Get ready to enjoy mroe fun than any four walls could ever contain! It's time you Got 'Em!&#10;Play Summary:&#10;The goal: trap your opponents' pawns before they trap yours. Last pawn free wins!&#10;&#10;Bright Got 'Em! (use colored side of the board)&#10;In Bright Got 'Em!, each player starts with 3 cards and pawn. Place your pawn on the same-colored start square (one of the four squares at the corners of the board's center square). The player who's birthday is closest, goes first.&#10;&#10;On your turn you will play a card, following each rule in the order they appear. Most cards have 2 instructions. The first tells you where you can place a wall and the second how many square you can move your pawn.&#10;&#10;Wall Placement Rules:&#10;Walls can only be placed along one edge of a square, between two squares.&#10;When a player's pawn is trapped by walls in a single square, that player is eliminated from the game. The edge of the board counts as a wall.&#10;There are a few cards that allow you to remove a wall or pass through a wall. However, you have to play these cards before your pawn is trapped! &#10;Once your pawn is trapped in a single square, you're out and your pawn is removed from the board.&#10;When you trap another player's pawn, thus eliminating him from the game, you may remove any 1 wall from the board.&#10;&#10;Moving Your Pawn&#10;Most cards allow you to move your pawn up to a specific number of squares.&#10;You can't move through walls, unless you play a card that allows it.&#10;You can't move through a square occupied by another pawn.&#10;You may only move orthogonally, never diagonally.&#10;You can stay where you are.&#10;You don't have to move the exact number of squares listed on the card. You can move fewer squares if you want.&#10;You can move zig zag, first in one direction, then in another, just not diagonally up to the number of squares specified on the card you played.&#10;&#10;After placing a wall and moving (or not), discard the card you played and draw another. (You should always have 3 cards in your hand.) Play passes to the player on your left.&#10;&#10;The last player to have a pawn on the board wins!&#10;&#10;Brainy Got 'Em! (use white side of board)&#10;You don't need any cards for this version. The goal is the same: trap your opponents' pawns while illuding capture yourself.&#10;&#10;On your turn, place a wall anywhere on the board, then move your pawn.&#10;The number of squares you can move your pawn is equal to 1 plus the number of walls on your square.

When Frederick II led his army into Silesia a long duel began between a still fragile Prussia and the first class power that was Austria. Featured here are eight battles from the fearsome contest: Mollwitz, Choutusitz, Hohenfriedburg, Kesseldorf, Kolin, Leuthen, Hochkirk, and Liegnitz. The game closely aligns with the Hold the Line system, but includes more advanced command rules, more detailed cavalry rules, optional rules for each warring nation&rsquo;s units, and much more.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Prussian army is well drilled and led by a bevy of talented generals, including Schwerin, Zieten, Leopold von Dessau, and of course Frederick the Great. The Austrian army is slightly weaker, but is aided by fearsome light infantry units and in later scenarios are led by such capable commanders as Daun and Loudon.&#10; As Prussia can you humble the Austrians and make your kingdom a first-class power? As Austria can you weather the Prussian storm and halt the first steps towards decline? The enemy approaches, the sound of cannon deafens, men shout commands, smoke fills the air.

249,14495,258164,Zombie World,2019,5.53336,240,2.75,"Zombie World is a card-based tabletop roleplaying game of survivors fighting against the living and the dead for their own place in the world. The game is designed for easy, quick, and intense play.&#10;&#10;In Zombie World, you take on the roles of ordinary people caught up in a zombie apocalypse, struggling to survive day after day, month after month, year after year, in a world destroyed by the restless dead. Maybe you&rsquo;re just an accountant who took up a machete to keep her friends and family safe. Maybe you&rsquo;re an escaped inmate trying to keep your criminal past a secret from your fellow survivors. Maybe you&rsquo;re a soldier trying to lead and protect your whole enclave in this ruined world.&#10;&#10;Zombie World has its roots in the Powered by the Apocalypse system used by tabletop RPGs like Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts, and Masks: A New Generation, but it takes that system in new directions, using special cards to generate characters, create situations, and resolve conflicts. Making a new character takes minutes: you draw a few cards, and you&rsquo;re ready to go. Every time you take an interesting action in the game, you draw a few cards that will tell you what happens to your survivor. In Zombie World, your story is about the larger group of characters more than it is about any single one of them, as you struggle, sacrifice, and strive to create a place where you and your allies might not just survive...but where you might live.&#10;&#10;Zombie World comes with all the cards, the playmats, the rules, and even a dry erase marker&mdash;everything you need in a small box you can easily fit into your bag and play on the fly. If you&rsquo;re a fan of The Walking Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, or World War Z, then Zombie World is the perfect game to satisfy your hunger!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",3,9,120,240,"['Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Open Drafting', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Storytelling']",17,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,"['Horror', 'Zombies']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1909,15,89,175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06311872747670974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07099042743784849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0807221734793865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08110482618119431,0.15779963431086613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08398019329095109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1599512755043063,0.0,0.0,0.0702598631597579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330237303824046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06909205334771598,0.0,0.06610889361270508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08677151711657181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07855221803994832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08884269886607811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14777920449183074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08312094792848619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06755164861254279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.087271917475539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11402216172636626,0.15850561123750403,0.08677151711657181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06909205334771598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07997563775215315,0.0,0.0,0.11244276873014497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0688655111818805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08884269886607811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37086214741616996,0.06456475622733591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08149402027072686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08398019329095109,0.0,0.08149402027072686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0647521424688396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16796038658190218,0.0,0.12875779937299184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052971990164453794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15189480654450227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06755164861254279,0.0700214599361812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08580254961490452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7001531230410198,0.0

But unbeknownst to many, there's a bunch of wacky drivers, clandestinely gathering in a huge movie studio, where they engage in completely crazy races, going through movie set after movie set, in search of glory, useful items... and Effixium (especially Effixium).&#10;&#10;Which of these &quot;Hollywood Racers&quot; will win the ultimate race ?&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;On your turn you may choose to perform up to 3 actions among: Move, Use one of your vehicle's abilities, ram, honk or repair.&#10;&#10;Each track (movie set) has different rules and you will have to adapt and use them to your advantage in order to outsmart your opponents.&#10;&#10;The first player who manages to reach the finish line with his two vehicles wins the race.&#10;&#10;",2,6,30,60,"['Action Points', 'Modular Board', 'Take That', 'Variable Player Powers']",8,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Humor', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Racing']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,989,11,70,116,0.18844464025807606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14459979588273758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16702688334331778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15379740060429498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12223451660785514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2056079495635654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2127734111268935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20341336766819443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2127734111268935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309772574999144,0.0,0.13609094595748408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15833363918955362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18010545200825995,0.1393378835675542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1926992702611984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39656557413686816,0.0,0.2056079495635654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15556714218593198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4073297310278746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20027781533767305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24795232459150157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15001264269295705,0.0,0.0,0.12603677004838962,0.0,0.0,0.15336374434336153,0.0

Einfach Genial, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each line of colored symbols that they enlarge.

Since the pieces in Ingenious had six colors on them, 'Ingenious Extreme features eight colors, giving players more to juggle as they try to score well across the board while shutting out opponents.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from their rack onto two empty octagon spaces of the game board. For each octagon on this tile, they score one point in that color for each octagon of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each octagon in a straight line from it. (In all you must check for scoring in seven directions from each half of the tile; you never look back from one half of the tile through the other half.) If a player brings the score of a color to 13, they immediately take another turn. At the end of their turn, they refill their rack to six tiles. (Before refilling their rack, if they have no tiles on it that contain hexes in their lowest-scoring color, they can discard all of their tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)&#10;&#10;When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 13 in each color, the game ends.

This information, along with the living or dead status of the witnesses, is used by the detective players to deduce who is the murderer player.&#10;&#10;",4,6,60,60,['Roll / Spin and Move'],10,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Deduction', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Murder / Mystery']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,704,5,21,75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29143271218453987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27460667766486946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3479601114242412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3395662437520593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.241488240479241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31373140948761535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2236959670399608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2795280110857791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.293781356762866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2613047204500289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40468415963701104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Each pub adds its own twist to the rules. Whenever a player reveals a Drink that includes one or more Chasers, the party pawn moves to a different open tavern after the Drink and any other pending effects are finished. Each tavern has an event that is triggered as the party arrives there. It also has its own Drink deck, and once that is exhausted, the tavern closes. The party crawls back to the Red Dragon Inn only once all other taverns have closed.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,60,"['Betting and Bluffing', 'Hand Management', 'Player Elimination', 'Variable Player Powers']",13,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Humor', 'Party Game']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1420,15,68,145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16327229708924254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16662489491772411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2105445029295496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21186862203806223,0.0,0.5575011082005431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1339643831295235,0.0,0.16548391359141143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11948681500052737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16273335688184706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1910271874156245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29407842490516334,0.13923233096480375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16838321963147254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21186862203806223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2560660567976262,0.0,0.0,0.1342788948772054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2079904917030324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15207015869473858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17020115980356687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16958830628431884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19012592083476737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Each player starts the game with one location, and cards in the deck consist of attackers, defenders, locations and support cards. To start a turn, you draw two cards, pick up any cards banked from a previous turn, and take the three cards passed to you earlier by the player on your left. You play or bank cards until you have only three in hand, then pass those to the player on your right and end your turn.&#10;&#10;Attackers target specific locations and earn points for the player wielding them if they're in play at the end of the game. Defenders try to remove attackers so that the location owner scores points for protecting the location. Support cards provide different abilities, such as enlarging your bank or providing time points (which can be used to draw additional cards). Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;Doctor Who: The Card Game &ndash; Classic Doctor Edition can be combined with Doctor Who: The Card Game.&#10;&#10;",2,4,20,60,[],14,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Movies / TV / Radio theme'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1594,10,71,146,0.13116609387760383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13602127819925333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13537952958752442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09538959806179852,0.0,0.117833140678265,0.0,0.0,0.13537952958752442,0.08508081767946349,0.0,0.22309471198451286,0.0,0.13412751107492898,0.2287540626658657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25271366533864287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14636413546343374,0.0,0.12789124700860896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09583881669694974,0.11823719887814192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14011624968234632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4390924063903012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14552491171260515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3431310939987986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12536163720884214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09428914311935051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11549466654274534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12439492371161513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14311254264118276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3017229240488162,0.10248541978052196,0.13116609387760383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18313619398879682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08883956911306433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11823719887814192,0.12737174044275393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11329118156565887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12789124700860896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08772736008600038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Next, each player is dealt an equal portion of the remaining deck, and must give information to the opponents; s/he must lay down a card of Higher Value, Lower Value, Different Value, and Different Suit.  Players are given notepads in the style of Clue to make notes about what cards are played, and what can't be the Hidden Card of each player. Then, each player takes it in turn to roll the die, and either reveal more information, or guess at the identity of an opponents' card.  Wrong guesses give no penalty, so you may as well try.  If you're right, you get one point for each card remaining in that player's hand.  This creates reverse suspense: players race to be first, because cards are dropped each round, and five points for last with a Hidden Card unguessed isn't enough to overcome someone who nailed two Hidden Cards early on.

276,25937,12308,Towers in Time,1994,5.47237,30,2.25,"From the box:&#10;In the beginning those that could master going between dimensions thought of it as novelty. There were worlds to discover, creatures to see and most importantly magic to master. But with all these things to keep them busy there was one thing they did not forget, Power. Soon it was easier to take from others than to find it on your own. The only place to hide was in great magical towers that they built between dimensions. All times in your world and in the others are at your disposal.&#10;&#10;Will you be the last to Reign in Towers in Time?&#10;&#10;Play overview:&#10;Each player represents a spellcaster, dueling with the other players for control of an abstractly defined extradimensional space.  Each player has five shields, represented by cards from that player's deck, that serve to anchor the player the dimension within the game's story, and as the player's presence in the game mechanically.  The goal is to eliminate the shields of all other players; when a player has no shields remaining, they are banished from the pocket dimension, and out of the game.  Victory goes to the last player with shields in play.&#10;&#10;To combat one another, players play Source cards, representing connections to various natural locations, be they landforms, weather phenomena, or natural disasters.  These resource cards allow the player to access Temper, the main resource in Towers in Time, themed to the four elements.  Using Temper, players pay the costs to summon creatures to wage war, conjure magical objects and artifacts to enhance the effectiveness of recruited creatures, and cast spells to strengthen their minions and weaken the opposing armies.  Additionally, once creatures are in play, most of them can provide Temper as well, although typically less than Source cards; most cards in Towers in Time are resource generators in addition to their other game effects.&#10;&#10;Source cards serve as the base for the titular Towers of Towers in Time.  Each Source has a default file of three ranks atop it, each space of which can be occupied by creatures and the cards they carry.  Creatures enter play within Towers, and must match the element represented by the Source atop which it stands (except for Neutral creatures, which may be played into any Tower).  There are rules to determine which creatures can enter play in which locations within a Tower, but once in play, most creatures can move between Towers, taking attached cards with them when they move.&#10;&#10;Turns do not follow the turn format common to many contemporary CCGs.  Instead, several phases are completed simultaneously by all players, then players alternate initiating and resolving a single action until both players have passed.  Action resolution varies depending on their effect, with some actions initiating a separate resolution phase with its own actions and timing (such as combat) and others are single-step actions (such as playing a card).  Additionally, a number of supplemental actions (&quot;free&quot; actions) facilitate utility functions, such as drawing Temper to pay for spells.  The opportunity to act first during the action round is determined by the player who won initiative during game setup (for the first turn only), or the player who did not take the last pass action on the previous turn.&#10;&#10;",2,2,30,30,['Hand Management'],12,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Fantasy']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3337,24,121,253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3243848288497784,0.3855295175273916,0.0,0.11085668880247224,0.0,0.0,0.09493484317773869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08319485156034523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1141468816717637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10371346775865754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11212871023160571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2229715716249262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09679865075827648,0.0,0.11024083692900642,0.0,0.0,0.07307741453406058,0.0,0.0,0.11278608359325787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1155740858707655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09493484317773869,0.08020971865910112,0.07595107392553016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09185284964654959,0.0,0.0,0.09641626775095903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10420510762588488,0.0,0.09493484317773869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28266404169650783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06984186745595695,0.0,0.07256867330211593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1688585828284478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07223436242314563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3096898636301489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07223436242314563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07633097385627757,0.08020971865910112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09529822528570937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07273727252110987,0.0,0.0,0.08295409395832685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10005221008049348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10137206779750071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2157988739356992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1959534763291745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10137206779750071,0.0,0.0,0.07014978486249168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27223790228770023,0.10679546128984663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08545577861375943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0899649763439503,0.0,0.0,0.08936182335651671,0.0,0.0,0.07770087757953113,0.0,0.11024083692900642,0.0,0.0,0.08624999618325584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08177916158448595,0.0

The players will connect Dream cards of 3 different Themes with multiple Dream Particles (images) on them. The deeper in your Dream you place your Dream cards, the more victory points you will get for them. But be careful placing Nightmares into your Dream! These tricky cards may look appealing, while they have so many different Dream Particles on them, but at the same time they will inevitably make you lose your Victory Points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game comprises 3 rounds with an undefined amount of turns. Each turn you will move one of 2 Dream Pendulums around the circle of Dream cards of 3 different Themes picking up (gaining or spending Magical Sand tokens) and adding them to your Dream.

282,19330,231331,Tilting at Windmills,2017,5.51309,30,1.3333,"&quot;A knight and his faithful sidekick amble on a dirty, empty road. The scorching sun blurs the boundaries of land and sky at the horizon. Only the choir of crickets breaks the tedious silence between the two travelers. The knight looks up and sights something in the distance. A gleam in his eyes appears from excitement.&#10;&ndash; Another giant! Quickly, my lance! &ndash; yells at his faithful companion.&#10;&ndash; But my good sir, it's only a windmill! &ndash; blinks the stumpy man towards the distant silhouette.&quot;&#10;&#10;Tilting at Windmills is a two-player game in which players control Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. The two characters move towards each other on the playing board. Players use movement cards to move either the knight or his companion. One round lasts until the two characters meet on the road. At the end of each round, a player gets a windmill/giant card with a victory point on it.&#10;&#10;There are two ways of winning the game. Either you collect more points than your opponent, or you force them to break all their lances; a player loses lances if they acquire a card with its giant side. The key tactic for this game is to force encounters at the right place and in the right time by adding up movement cards.&#10;&#10;",2,2,20,30,['Point to Point Movement'],12,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Abstract Strategy', 'Card Game', 'Novel-based']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1265,18,63,131,0.0,0.0,0.16153222239551368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12647103192799508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3082072936622809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13963273522881325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14715123617663955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2630504887720372,0.0,0.09810344037892742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16153222239551368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16234817348951236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1648898988068305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.256695201922709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5328139382911307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15275602591432946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10980913103366212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12193309681083571,0.0,0.1406320601371559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2897406430023614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22114728839199801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15144804670904802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10346255743741624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10049691959650842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11811921032236218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16758575976187987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15766299291674385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Otherwise, a player can choose to knock to end the round, after which each other player can take one final turn. No matter how the round ends, players then sum the value of cards in their hand.

To reduce the advantages of a player's &quot;helicopter view&quot; and to provide a more believable simulation of ancient warfare, Armati does not permit the free-wheeling unit maneuvers common to other rules sets. Unit movement is controlled, especially when in close proximity to the enemy. the General's plan of battle is critical to success because it cannot be altered from moment to moment.&#10;&#10;Armati represents soldier types based on their tactical usage rather than their weapons and armor, although equipment contributes to a unit's fighting efficiency.

Your job is to produce tradegoods, recruit colonists and make as much gold for the West Islandia Trading Company as you can, while working your way once through the deck of cards. If you make it completely through the deck without losing all of your colonists you have won and may then count up your Victory Points to see how well you governed.&#10; To play you'll need the 54 game cards, Colony Map card, and 10-12 small paperclips.&#10;&#10;There are 4 types of cards in the game:&#10;&#10;     Purple - Ship tradegoods for gold&#10;     Gray - Produce tradegoods for later sale&#10;     Green - Upgrades and expansions to your colony&#10;     Red - Hazards &#10;&#10;&#10;Play: Deal one card from the bottom of the deck face-up on top of the Colony Map, centered in the game title section, with the 3 numbers facing up. Then deal a second card face up on top of the first so the 3 punched holes align with the 3 numbers underneath. These 3 numbers are used to determine resource values during the action on the top card.&#10;&#10;Read the text on the top card and complete the action. You may gain or lose gold, colonists or tradegoods.  Anytime you see a colored circle icon referenced in the action text, look at the number above, in the matching colored circle, for its value. After an action is completed, discard both cards to a pocket. Then draw two new cards.&#10;&#10;You cannot have more than a maximum of 9 Colonists during the game. The Gold track, located at the top of the Colony Map, will allow you to bank up to 299 gold. &#10;The bottom Tradegoods track will allow you to store a maximum of 20 tradegoods unless you build one or two of the Warehouses (each costs 10 gold), then you can store up to 10 additional tradegoods in each warehouse for a game maximum of 40 tradegoods. The righthand track lists various Trading Company Employee bonus upgrades. Add extra paperclips as needed to the gold and tradegoods tracks for the 10s and 100s placemarkers.&#10;&#10;Employees: The five Trading Company Employees on the righthand track each have a gold cost listed to hire them and a value in VP. You may hire each employee once, sliding a paperclip on top of them to mark them as hired. &#10;&#10;     The Shipwright (cost 20 gold) lets you add +1 to the tradegood number inside the circle at the top of the card when you produce tradegoods&#10;     The Recruiter (cost 20 gold) lets you add +1 to the colonist number inside the circle at the top of the card when you gain colonists&#10;     The Trader (cost 20 gold)  lets you add +1 to the gold number inside the circle at the top of the card when you ship tradegoods&#10;     The Advocate (cost 30 gold) lets you subtract -1 to any number inside the circles at the top of the card when referenced on the red Hazard cards&#10;     The Financier (cost 40 gold) lets you ignore all red Hazard cards stating you must pay Shareholders.&#10;&#10;&#10;",1,1,10,10,['Hand Management'],8,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'City Building', 'Economic', 'Print & Play', 'Renaissance']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,3066,20,153,203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15023243779693776,0.0,0.181503978149048,0.0,0.04826054105254944,0.0,0.08793440169833894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04826054105254944,0.0,0.036078739345682044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052864877686400996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044305904318459634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10153309116469297,0.0,0.0,0.05223465088631229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05050283683655949,0.03957715898891759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052864877686400996,0.07915431797783518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03714754975407205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0866283721980631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7147821810743381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034003747125913225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04946021227969373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048032847741386824,0.0,0.0,0.06983107850891158,0.0,0.0,0.15070368620358818,0.10082625075152812,0.0,0.0,0.05163244360626341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04872774021609244,0.0,0.0,0.04111247177255565,0.0,0.16726960379152297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045191672876118735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04594450171756982,0.0,0.0926744168687663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048492126745037493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4758862981000441,0.0,0.19784084911877492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048492126745037493,0.0,0.0,0.04019587075804531,0.0,0.09188900343513964,0.0,0.04138616659858015,0.0,0.0,0.03598562947325815,0.0,0.0,0.04006984721568989,0.0,0.03994498519715822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04826054105254944,0.0,0.0,0.0

309,13156,2480,Tribes,1998,5.5416,240,2.0769,"Tribes is a role-playing game that plays a lot like a board game and simulates the way our ancestors lived long ago. The players are cave men and women. They hunt and gather food, make their tribal laws, and deal with natural disasters, but the object of the game is simple: Look after the children! In this game, the way to win is to have the most kids and do whatever you have to do to make sure they survive to adulthood. The players must know when to cooperate, and when to cut their losses and protect their own families. Players can re-create &ndash; and change &ndash; the earliest human societies by instituting their own laws and social patterns, and see what effects the rules of society have on their ability to survive and reproduce.&#10;&#10;With several copies of the game and a referee, it's possible to have several tribes playing at once, competing, trading, exchanging members, and even making war on each other.&#10;&#10;",4,8,240,240,"['Cooperative Game', 'Role Playing', 'Voting']",0,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Prehistoric'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,940,7,38,104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21109748989717386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1876819999894469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16214106095487538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21109748989717386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1585261320888316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1903319112459743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27540268606803564,0.2048044688994324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3200910808138149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2930080761050213,0.1903319112459743,0.0,0.15656521750594243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16322046989226494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15151667330406832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1827465927809635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3703146582819136,0.0,0.0,0.19811713670117975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20135624508334074,0.31605823049485066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14610679514330077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

To win as the German player you must capture Paris and cut it off from supply for two complete turns.  The French must capture two German supply centres to win.

Lovecraft.&#10;&#10;Cultistorm is the expression of our respect and love for H. P. Lovecraft. It is more than just an ordinary board game &ndash; this is a Lovecraftian gaming experience with literary and musical dimensions. Our theme choice was motivated by a deep commitment to the work and heritage of H. P. Lovecraft. We want to create an excellent board game for those who know and love Lovecraft, and we would like to make Lovecraft&rsquo;s work known to those who are board game fans.&#10;&#10;Each round of Cultistorm consists of 6 phases where players combat cultists and try to close 5 portals.

The Narrative Expansion is a story-driven game mode in which the stories impact the game itself.&#10;- Solo Expansion for those solitary detectives who wish take up the fight on their own.&#10;- Campaign Expansion: seven connected and increasingly challenging scenarios introducing new game mechanics.&#10;- Overlord Expansion: this adds a sixth player who takes on the role of Lovecraft himself. As a puppet master, this player controls the cultists, and thus the whole game.&#10;- Nine minor expansion modules: each of these introduces new game mechanics, increasing the replayability and difficulty of Cultistorm. Most modules can be played simultaneously.&#10;- Game Night Expansion (as add-on): this unique and innovative expansion provides the possibility of combining up to six separate Cultistorm games into one epic story.

312,10476,285208,World of Draghan: Sneaky Ol' Dragons,2019,5.56831,40,2.0,"This is the second game in the World of Draghan Series, sequel to World of Draghan: Once Upon a Dragon.&#10;The game box also contains 2 additional dragon cards you can use in Once Upon a Dragon.&#10;&#10;Many years have passed since the truce of Draghan, a day when both dragons and peasants agreed to live alongside each other respectfully. All residents of Draghan, be it skin or scale-covered, celebrate this anniversary with a race. Organised by the folk but run by the old dragons. The race is to a chest full of treasure, the very same chest that was offered at the truce to buy the dragon's favour. In the true spirit of the days gone by, the dragons now pit their wits against each other instead of the Draghanian folk...and today it seems you are a dragon...so you better be prepared!&#10;&#10;Sneaky Ol' Dragons is a racing game full of surprises. A round starts with drafting the cards you are going to play that round. From the cards drafted you always play 2 cards on yourself and one card on each other player. So make sure when you draft you don't keep only good cards or you'll also help your opponents.&#10;&#10;When all cards are assigned the cards will be executed one by one and the dragons will move on the racing track. Most cards just make your dragon go forward, but there are also many action cards available that influence the race.&#10;&#10;Will you find a knight on your way? Only if you have enough courage left you will be able to beat him and continue your way. If you don't have the courage you'll have to run backward.&#10;Just maybe your dragon will stop to smell a flower and blow himself backward when he sneezes (dragon have hay fever!) while the other dragons in front of you jump forward to avoid burnt bottoms.&#10;Or will you encounter a novice wizard. You really can't predict what will happen when he fires off a spell with his wand and you are accidently in his way.&#10;And the race will have quite a lot of additional surprises waiting for you to discover.&#10;&#10;The game also includes some variations.&#10;For example you can choose to hold the race in the enchanted forest on a &quot;safe&quot; forest path. Or you can hold the race in the mountains where you have to make sure you avoid the rockslides and jump over the dangerous holes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",2,6,20,40,"['Action Queue', 'Open Drafting', 'Take That']",8,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Medieval', 'Racing']",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2346,30,111,199,0.0,0.10490601253166823,0.0,0.07884637741561543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20262834790736134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10229497309711895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08962237392671157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10490601253166823,0.0,0.0,0.10083617351621975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1090179542291921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07973521089590144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10778122214109985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08776691022340208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09126678313823736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11098013609354561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09230109190526481,0.0,0.0,0.10965709026227459,0.2206218407148997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09812551801993867,0.0,0.0,0.10383266414760071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08806786918579158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08930460127388383,0.0,0.0,0.10131417395368067,0.0,0.09230109190526481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10436427507510743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21989635469652252,0.0,0.13580852743008995,0.0,0.0,0.07121685398789711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0820869927780955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10965709026227459,0.0,0.0,0.09337444028933231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08602511968526903,0.0,0.6167901322834396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14143868470588175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2143649113539286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09645207321982872,0.0,0.0,0.09026877349106785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11098013609354561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09769783542596729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10383266414760071,0.0,0.11166547905238593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06427459376995566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25235793357687736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1590207695442877,0.0

Prevented from retreat by orders of Adolf Hitler, the German forces soon found themselves pocketed, their only supply source an airfield at the town called Korsun. The Soviets relentlessly tighten their stranglehold against the German troops in the pocket. At the same time, the Germans mount increasingly strong relief efforts against the outer Soviet perimeter. Can the German relief forces break the Soviet lines before the Soviet forces completely destroy the pocketed troops?&#10;&#10;Cherkassy Pocket was designed by John Desch, and features a system similar to his wargames Wave of Terror and Berlin 45. Units are battalions and brigades, and the ground scale is 1.25 miles per hex. Each game turn represents 24 hours, and each player gets to move and perform combat twice in a turn. When it's time to activate friendly units, a player may choose to move first and then fight or vice versa. There are special rules to reflect the failure of Soviet tank maintenance, the use of the Korsun airfield as a supply source, Soviet difficulties in coordinating multi-formation attacks, and the ability for tank units to infiltrate enemy lines. Four scenarios allow you to play different portions of the battle, or to play the whole 23 turn campaign.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 1.25 miles / 2 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigades&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (540 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page Cherkassy Pocket rulebook&#10;Three single-side printed Player Aid Cards&#10;One 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;",2,2,240,240,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']",12,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,"['Wargame', 'World War II']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1930,13,118,185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15842534452441268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1755788151743653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18821513316631255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13685730034347904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1669651028206255,0.0,0.18604522255171277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14131653531496233,0.0,0.10877092776608371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1791305594931037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12674561468568132,0.0,0.18933736537343407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1773223916286825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17821810393483536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19048600545302213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18100828910932315,0.12110113299542623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2817877848116979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18933736537343407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13385235480911437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13843211275394104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33250492628258016,0.18604522255171277,0.0,0.0,0.18006039619845396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13883388416652157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18006039619845396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23412908186611264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3407288253095709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11032073892065274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

318,17864,116739,Decision: Iraq,2013,5.51842,240,2.3333,"Decision: Iraq is a game that emphasizes the fight against the insurgency in Iraq, which began in 2003 following the US-led invasion of that country. Historically, the quick US-Coalition victory over Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s military forces in March of that year quickly degenerated into an insurgency that swept the country. The situation was eventually turned around, but only after a steep learning curve for the United States and its partners. The game shows some of the major factors involved. &#10; There are two players in the game: The Insurgents (who want to seize control of Iraq. These represent various Iraqi Rebels and Foreign Fighters, the latter including Al Qaeda and Iranian support, among others), and the Counterinsurgents (who want to restore stability to a democratic Iraq, as well as defeat any Al Qaeda elements which may be operating in the country.)

Put two dots next to each other inside the circle in the top half...&quot;&#10;&#10;",3,8,30,30,['Line Drawing'],0,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Party Game'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,457,8,29,55,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39657728031151823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13071309733846592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30570839374369024,0.620179853073005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20417378679823606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15285419687184512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13163918619218096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20294260871688583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15475704854527075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18464675005962966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2017397361024383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19401502877561697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1837959564474215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17453847217049068,0.15285419687184512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Sidney Addy's Glossary of Sheffield Words describes a game in which &quot;a number of people sit in a row, or in chairs round a parlor. A lighted taper is handed to the first, who says:&#10;&#10;Jack's alive, and likely to live&#10;If he dies in your hand, you've a forfeit to give.&#10;&#10;The one in whose hand the light expires has to pay the forfeit.&quot;&#10;&#10;That was written in 1888.&#10;&#10;Apparently later it was played with an actual hot potato. Whoever ended up with the potato when the music stopped was kicked out and the potato elimination match continued.&#10;&#10;By the 1950s, manufactured Hot Potato games were already on store shelves. Remco&rsquo;s late 1950s version used small plastic pans for each player, covered up so that no one would know who was holding the real potato. In the 1960s, there was &ldquo;Spudsie,&rdquo; a wind-up potato who emitted a loud DING when time was up. In the 1980s, there was the battery-powered &ldquo;Chip O&rsquo;Grattin.&rdquo; Most recently there is a battery-powered talking potato, which shouts out &ldquo;Yahoo!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;",2,6,10,10,[],4,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Action / Dexterity', ""Children's Game"", 'Party Game', 'Real-time']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1251,13,100,136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2402031926990013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19243106458692696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16935159110915968,0.0,0.0,0.22274838298298158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3108816314513989,0.0,0.22609672146582205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24468195170644216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22609672146582205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15292740275470795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2175411847860211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16160034075192037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15399211396030096,0.0,0.40351183539779695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22167132668088851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2881774956658846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18374677697429057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20575273515822934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18317068745827836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20742659857806656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In Artifact, players are archaeologists researching sites around the globe to search for artifacts, which are then shipped back to the museums in order to produce exhibitions that increase funding for future digs and earn prestige to win the game. Actions and funds are limited, however, and competition is fierce.

On 22 June, more than 2,000,000 Soviet soldiers stormed the heavily fortified lines of the badly outnumbered German Army Group Centre. The German defences quickly crumbled under several sledgehammer blows. German armoured reserves rushed forward, desperately counterattacking to stem the on-rushing Red tide in the climactic Battle of Minsk.&#10;&#10;Firestorm Campaign&#10;In Firestorm&mdash;Bagration, you command the Soviet or German forces fighting for Byelorussia in the critical months of June and July 1944. &#10;Put yourself in command on the Eastern Front using your Flames Of War historical miniatures on the table&shy;top. Each battle recreates a major engagement. The outcomes of your battles determine the fate of the campaign.&#10;&#10;The General&rsquo;s Wargame&#10;The General&rsquo;s Wargame is a fast-paced two-player Board game based on Firestorm&mdash;Bagration that uses all the contents of the box and takes 60 to 90 minutes to play. Can be used stand alone or with your FOW campaign.&#10;&#10;Total War&#10;Total War is designed to put big armies on big tables. Instead of a mere company, you can field your entire collection with thousands of points of Flames Of War troops arrayed across a large battlefield.&#10;&#10;Partisans &amp; Polizei&#10;While the generals plan their campaigns, more personal battles are being fought. Vasiliy Kravchenko, a partisan leader, and his Polizei nemesis Dieter von Gaudron wage their own war in the fields and forests of Byelorussia. This presents a small-scale skirmish game for use with your FOW figures.&#10;&#10;River Crossings &amp; No Retreat&#10;Also included are new rules for crossing rivers, common yet formidable obstacles in Byelorussia. Use these rules to succeed in the new River Crossing Mission and the Crossing the Drut scenario, both found within.

331,16765,1987,Emperor of China,1972,5.52286,60,2.0476,"In this highly abstract strategic wargame, you are trying to conquer China by being the first to occupy fifteen provinces at the completion of a complete round of play (all players having had an equal number of turns).  Alternatively, the game can be timed and scored.&#10;&#10;You start with a small number of provinces under your control.  Population counters of your colour indicate this; if a province has extra population, it can move some into an adjacent unoccupied province --this is the simplest way of conquest.  Merger, diplomacy and force (Risk-like combat) are your other options.  Each turn you draw a Yin card and a Yang card.  Yin is bad, Yang is good.  Without looking at either card's instructions, you assign them to two of your provinces.  Yang will most likely increase your recruitment (which is normally three population per turn), but could also give you the capability to cross a natural barrier like a mountain range.  Yin will hurt you.  Some cards you end up holding in your hand.&#10;&#10;A player may attempt to convince another player to merge with his empire.  If the second player agrees then the smaller empire is absorbed by the larger and both players continue play as senior (larger) and junior (smaller) partners.  The absorbed empire no longer has a separate turn nor separate recruitment.  This concept of &quot;shared victory&quot; is intriguing, particularly with a larger number of players.&#10;&#10;The game allows any number of players but components are only provided for five.&#10;&#10;",2,5,60,60,"['Alliances', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Negotiation', 'Team-Based Game']",10,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Ancient', 'Negotiation', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1533,16,67,152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1797226781154307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1363764810629259,0.0,0.18826984322875756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18275216401594954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15682000167623047,0.0,0.0,0.15867639781143797,0.0,0.18071139172481937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14008268727282516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1418265489485274,0.0,0.10578708637928932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1871143436731763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1314831263307338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17247101531754058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17506358784277598,0.0,0.0,0.12035568990885279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18945387650204273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2845452143058011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11895760512498957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13840002651313557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47363835498629103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1859860348816844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11923398001796805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1626197895561511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17163706540738413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12870258448918936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11499246200263577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1599551645587761,0.14008268727282516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12737052907788948,0.0,0.0,0.1418265489485274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17081737175158768,0.0,0.0,0.0

The board simulates an old map and is divided into four trading regions, each with multiple ports.  Each region sells a different spice and the market price is controlled by card play.  However, an &quot;expert price&quot; can be obtained by guessing the identity of a mystery spice.  The game actually comes with around twenty small containers of real spices that get thrown into a bag.  If a player is trying to get an expert price, he picks one container  at random, opens it, sniffs it, and guesses what it is from a list of common and not so common spices.&#10;&#10;This is not the main aspect of gameplay, but it does spice it up, so to speak.  It is mostly a commodity speculation game; not only do the players need to get good prices on the spices that they are bringing back to Europe, they also need to lay in supplies in order to keep their ship on the move.  Obtaining the money to buy  supplies requires selling spices to regions other than the spice's region of origin; and in this case, a player wants the spice price to be high.&#10;&#10;Event cards add a random aspect to the game and there are pirates prowling the waters who are out to ruin a captain's best laid plans.&#10;&#10;Title translates to &quot;The Spice Route&quot;.&#10;&#10;",2,5,90,90,"['Commodity Speculation', 'Deduction']",8,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Economic', 'Nautical']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1351,11,57,140,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16651566362995052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15136952345609608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15447771232024743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15086987272649194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19056754639883253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18337971531382813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11077606286160475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12908210372212855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18633394050854782,0.0,0.3752343838074794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18150346135704523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18150346135704523,0.0,0.16651566362995052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16134583279136083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1843450821341455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17152715202178048,0.0,0.14349119753332829,0.0,0.0,0.19282770055766832,0.0,0.3017397454529839,0.0,0.0,0.1916847805874649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1262761335949066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3833695611749298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17795089117323443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19399751521563874,0.0,0.0,0.16583926096286536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

For the first time Austrian, Swedish and Russian forces pose simultaneous threats to the Prussian heartland. By mid-August the Russian offensive crests on the Oder River, laying siege to the fortress of C&uuml;strin. Force marching from Silesia through blazing summer heat, Frederick races to bring about a decisive battle. On 25 August near the village of Zorndorf 43,000 Russians and 36,000 Prussians fight one of the most savage battles of the war. For nearly 10 hours they hammer one another, yet by day's end neither army yields, despite staggering losses - nearly half the Russians and one-third of the Prussians were casualties.

The reader says &quot;1-2-3-Choose&quot; and everyone points their finger at someone (you can choose yourself, if you wish). If you choose the person the reader chose, you get a chip.

The game is meant for 2 to 3 players: one player always takes the British side while the combined Spanish-French force can be played by another one or split in two, with each player taking command of one of the nationalities. It can also be played by any number of players, giving them command of just some of one side's ships. Before starting the game, players should agree on wether they will use any optional rules.&#10;&#10;SEQUENCE OF PLAY&#10;&#10;After setting up the scenario by the playbook, play proceeds in turns. Each turn consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;INITIATIVE PHASE:&#10;Players determine initiative. Initially, it is held by the British side.&#10;&#10;COMBAT PHASE:&#10;1.- The initiative player fires his cannons, any hits are not applied yet.&#10;2.- The non-initiative player fires.&#10;3.- Any damaged caused by both sides is now applied simultaneously.&#10;&#10;MOVEMENT PHASE:&#10;1.- The non-initiative player moves his units.&#10;1.- The initiative player moves his.&#10;&#10;CREW ACTIONS PHASE:&#10;Played simultaneously, the initiative player executes his actions first.&#10;&#10;1.- Grapple and grapple disengagement attempts. &#10;2.- Boarding attempts. Require previous successful grapple.&#10;3.- Rigging and fallen masts removal.&#10;4.- Put out fires.&#10;5.- Check for sinking ships.&#10;6.- Check for surrendering ships.&#10;&#10;After turn 24 is completed, calculate victory points for sunk,  captured or damaged ships and determine the winner.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10;1 Playboard, made up of 5 DIN A3 sections. &#10;60 ships miniatures.&#10;180 detachable masts.&#10;60 ship cards.&#10;1 stickers sheet.&#10;2 markers sheets.&#10;1 combat table sheet.&#10;1 miscellaneous tables sheet.&#10;1 player aid.&#10;2 fleet setup sheets.&#10;6 six sided dice.&#10;1 rulebook.&#10;1 Volume I Trafalgar booklet.&#10;&#10;",2,60,120,240,"['Dice Rolling', 'Line of Sight', 'Measurement Movement', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Simulation']",14,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Miniatures', 'Napoleonic', 'Nautical', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2313,47,231,196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2125749268857056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14503322472188487,0.0,0.11468083949273092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14503322472188487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4610363478756716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14099760205819373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31094238422170134,0.11673158178507567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15734699888370066,0.0,0.0,0.15639818866065627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15367878262522386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09957223515087119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14574691722921787,0.09957223515087119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3156577599559558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15547119211085067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11434896458225408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4119881573991508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12443542070724363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14873514142026614,0.12661555023780835,0.11401979888493366,0.13973741906010773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11779743874922814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09112814950638454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071076118656106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12844871018066653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In this game of true court cases, players are in the position to judge for themselves. Five hundred cards outline the cases--and with names like &quot;Trespassing Hounds,&quot; &quot;Shocking News,&quot; &quot;Forced Nuptials,&quot; and &quot;Quality Chicken,&quot; players are sure to be intrigued. The game can be played by two players or two teams. To start, a team rolls the die. A 1, 2, or 3 lets them know how many scorecard spaces they can fill in if they arrive at the correct verdict. After reading a case, they deliberate, debate, and finally decide for or against the plaintiff. A correct verdict advances the team. An incorrect verdict leaves them cooling their heels. The first team to arrive at the finish line wins.

To complete a challenge, you lay out the insects as shown on the challenge card, then place the chameleon token adjacent to one edge of the grid. A move consists of eating (i.e., flipping face down) all the insects of one type in the row/column next to the chameleon, then advancing the chameleon clockwise around the perimeter as many spaces as the number of insects you just ate. If you land on a row/column with no uneaten insects &mdash; yet insects remain elsewhere in the layout &mdash; then you've lost the challenge; if you eat all the insects, you win.&#10;&#10;Kameleo can also be played as a two-player game. Lay out the insects on a challenge card, then the first player chooses where to place the chameleon token. Players take turns eating a type of insect and moving the chameleon. Whoever can't eat on their turn loses the round, and whoever first loses three rounds loses the game.&#10;&#10;",1,2,0,0,[],8,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,[],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1040,11,43,99,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15840306583374186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17014362451720733,0.1819175378294022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15198428701663214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27016007591230573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16336156653692915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19291086815035885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12421472955246839,0.0,0.0,0.26054865405231675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15015866530112196,0.1960648568483596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15387630935427504,0.1284698150209718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2569396300419436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1357556952498893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12936424760250648,0.15946483493901856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20178764026342905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12476236492893263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20059161332782638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15198428701663214,0.3818193289833627,0.18621956445454926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3485059743347168,0.1422672927898869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

366,15085,252712,Carrossel,2019,5.53027,45,2.25,"Four brothers own an old merry-go-round (carrossel) and are working together to sell as much tickets as possible while at the same time competing to see who sells the most tickets by the end of the day!&#10;&#10;With charming components and artwork Carrossel aims to bring up to 4 players together around board that rotates between each play, and where everything is done simultaneously with almost zero-downtime: Players choose, reveal, resolve and score every single play at the same time without ever becoming chaotic.&#10;&#10;Carrossel is a family abstract strategy game for up to four players. Players play on the side of the board that rotates to meet them each round. At the beginning of the game, client cards are drawn and placed in front of each ticket booth in sets of three. In each round, all players simultaneously choose and play one of their carrossel cards, numbered from 1 to 12, and one of their carrossel tiles that come in twelve tiles of four different colors/types, plus two wild tiles. The carrossel tiles are simultaneously placed on the spaces indicated by the carrossel cards. Players are looking to get three carrossel tiles in a row that match the three corresponding client cards. Whenever they achieve this, they place client stand-ups on each of them to show that those tickets have been sold and give the cards to the respective players who earned them (the owners of the carrossel tiles).&#10;While it is possible to complete a sequence with only your own tiles, most sequences will be completed by using tiles from other players.

The player controlling the ball chooses the action his team will go for, then both players roll the dice to see the outcome. After this, both players move their team according to the tactics they have chosen. There is always a small chance of random events such as a yellow or red card.&#10;&#10;Thanks to the flexible rubber board, FUBA can easily be played outdoors, too.&#10;&#10;http://fubaboardgame.com&#10;&#10;",2,2,90,90,"['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Simulation']",12,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Sports'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,876,13,54,112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14225246825066284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18455778045445592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16405378154574232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.143856077199848,0.20273080019465506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16979643644278444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14854335401080349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18733204040789625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17703536413768944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1480990974690714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12670773024300658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19901993230625903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2677873554946241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19784031000902932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17047606637906562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17550356948999182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1836653873520828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1711648191369616,0.0,0.0,0.14509255414005473,0.0,0.5134944574108848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29979935811903285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1159624564789969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1403159625806354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14345045208326007,0.0

382,13398,155754,An Army at Dawn: Tunisia 1942-1943 – A Panzer Grenadier Game,2015,5.53987,360,2.8,"From the Avalanche Press website:&#10;&#10;In early November 1942, American and British forces stormed ashore in French-ruled Morocco and Algeria, beginning a campaign to press the Axis into a small bridgehead around the ports of Tunis and Bizerte in Tunisia. The U.S. Army had its first exposure to combat in the European Theater, while fresh British forces joined the veteran Eighth Army against the Axis. French troops fought first against the Allies, then with them. Inside the shrinking perimeter, German and Italian units continued to offer fierce resistance.&#10;&#10;An Army at Dawn is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these battles.  The game includes four semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen. The maps are fully compatible with many others in the Panzer Grenadier series (and those from Panzer Grenadier (Modern) and Infantry Attacks, too).  There are 517 playing pieces: ultra-thick, scorchless, sootless laser-cut. You do not need any other game to play any of its 40 scenarios.

The excitement builds as you have fewer and fewer cards left to play, but less space to play them in as you reach the edge of the world. (The table&rsquo;s edge). Every country card is different due to their varying border connections and hence no two games are ever the same in this clever game that you will want to play again and again. Play as a stand alone game or combine with Mapominoes games for other continents to make to expand the game to cover the world. A simple game with hidden strategic depth that gives it broad appeal to both children and adults.&#10;&#10;",2,5,30,30,['Tile Placement'],8,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Educational', 'Travel']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1466,12,49,151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1613589130152882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341733611048875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11339116864180453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09487348789821154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16321042055492666,0.12363267178098475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1622746034513806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16416726900698894,0.0,0.0,0.23286749170478396,0.10712240488160171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14033996801949206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15624341280619317,0.0,0.0,0.1263308209347172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10973536968373522,0.0,0.0,0.15788122873439434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2795811346205217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11675031210030154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15389907958413637,0.0,0.1595845744396019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27742517317629256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15788122873439434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.285222662552929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4010928741358927,0.12039734655356316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13184611717232578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13465447316402654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11643374585239198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35710420624470207,0.0
390,24229,8057,1944: Second Front – From D-Day to Victory in the West,1990,5.49158,300,4.0,"1944: SECOND FRONT begins with the Allies well established in France following the D-Day invasions. The Allies are gathered to attempt their breakout and begin the race toward the German frontier. Each player has Combat Units and Headquarters available, and is capable of maneuvering across the map and engaging enemy pieces in combat. You must master the deceptively concise rules for Activation and Movement Point expenditure. And at any given time, you will face the decision of which army to Activate in any one phase - and your opponent will have an immediate opportunity to react . The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality. There is a track display that you use during movement/combat. As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions. It's easier to play than it is to describe.  For example, suppose you have an armor division near the enemy and a couple of infantry divisions further away. If you move up the infantry to attack and make a breakthrough, the armored unit will probably not be able to move very far through the breach. In effect, the armored unit has spent most of the turn waiting around for the infantry to get in position and make its attack.  The game puts emphasis on elite units on both sides and on the brittleness of the powerful British formations (no replacements).

Otherwise it survives and the alert is passed. You can play an End of Alert, of course. Two Airplane cards in a row (by the same player) will also sink the convoy; the Airplane Hit card defends.

A circuit of palaces is seeded with the items, and a marker shows which palace is being auctioned. As players bid, they move a gondola along the circuit, which points which the next auction will be when this one is resolved. Players start with 30 points on the scoring track, and there's a marker to allow debt on the same track. Debt costs double at the game end. There's also a marker to allow you to bribe the auctioneer and take a lot for no cost.&#10;&#10;A series price tiles show the potential value of the next completed lot.

When placing a card, he can lay it face-up (taking one chip from the bank) or face-down (placing one of his chips on the card); when taking a column, it must have at least two cards and at most six.&#10;&#10;After taking a column, the player sums the cards in that column, with a loach turning the negative ponds positive and with two of the acorns worth either 1 or 5 at the player's discretion. If the column's sum is between 0-6, the player takes that many chips from the bank; if more than 6 or less than 0, he pays the difference to the bank.

399,16980,232358,Killing Code: Venice Vendetta,2017,5.52194,75,2.25,"Killing Code: Venice Vendetta is a cooperative reasoning game in which the players must work together to discover the identity of a killer in the city before it is too late. One player acts as the killer, secretly assuming the identity of one of the citizens of Venice and looking for opportunities to kill some of the others. The other players act together to unmask the killer's identity. Within the round limit, the killer must keep their identity hidden and complete their killings, while the other players must investigate the murder methods to discover clues leading to the killer's unmasking and stop these atrocities.&#10;&#10;Aside from the standard game mode, the game includes five scenarios that can provide players with more rules and story experiences.&#10;&#10;Game Playing:&#10;&#10;Stage 1: Flip Over Cards:&#10;&#10;At the start of this stage, the killer takes all the character cards still in play, shuffles them face down and places the pile in front of him.&#239;&#188;&#136;In the first round of a normal game, this will be all 13 character cards, reduced each round when the killer takes victims).&#10;Deal a number of character cards according to the number of players, then flip those cards face-up and place them in area easily reached by all players.  These will be the character cards availible for use this round.&#10;&#10;Stage 2: The Investigators Act&#10;Starting with the investigator to the left of the killer, that player chooses one of the availible character cards for this round and places it face-up in front of him or herself.  Once a character card has been placed in front of a player no other investigator may choose that card.  After placing the card infront of him or herself, the investigator can move that character according to the movement value on the card and one active ability on the card.  After the investigator finishes moving his or her chosen character and taking any actions, the next investigator clockwise repeats this process until all investigators have taken a character card.&#10;&#10;Stage 3: The Killer Acts&#10;The killer's stage consists of 2 parts: movement and murder.&#10;-Movement-&#10;The killer can choose from 2 options for movement&#239;&#188;&#154;&#10;&#10;     Use the remaining 2 character cards unchosen by the non-killer players.  The killer chooses what order to use these cards in.&#10;     Use 1 card in front of a non-killer player.&#10;&#10;&#10;After the killer has taken his or her movement action(s), he or she is ready to take a life.&#10;-Murder-&#10;The killer selects a killing code card from his or her hand, using its ability to end the lives of one or more characters based on the qualifications of the killing code card text.  Each round the killer can only make use of 1 killing code card.  Please refer to the killing code card section of this rulebook for further clarification.  The killer dons the mask, dramatically announces who will die, then lays that character's marker down in the block they were just alive in.  Search the character cards for the character killed and place that card face up on the grave marker from this round, then the killer places the killing code card that he or she used face down on top of that character card.

405,19005,35163,Swashbuckled!,2008,5.51431,120,1.8333,"Swashbuckled! is Fun-at-Home Games first game. Played with different colored sailing ships and on a beautiful large world map board, the game is set in the year 1806, at the peak of Napoleon's power. The game is played on three levels: the first level is rolling dice and moving one of six cargoes indicated on cargo cards from one port/continent to another, avoiding ever changing bad weather and war zones, lest you sink at sea.&#10;&#10;The second level features pirates that every player gets a chance to be, by the pick of specially marked new cargo cards, once your voyage is complete. Pirates need not reveal themselves until they so desire. Poker face is critical to this game. Pirates can attack merchant ships by rolling additional dice. Knowing when to hold and when to attack are critical to success. However, there are also a few Lord Nelsons at sea - the game's police force -  that can Neutralize pirates.&#10;&#10;Finally, there is the most exciting third level; the Secret Treasure Islands. With every game there is at least one, truly secret treasure worth 50,000 pounds that makes the game a fun, fast, in your face adventure.

If the judge likes your answer the best, you win the round.&#10;&#10;For &quot;Create2&quot;, players look at two cards, then take elements from each card to create something new, such as combining the two wheels of a motorcycle with a rope to create a double-decker tire swing.&#10;&#10;",0,0,0,0,['Storytelling'],10,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Party Game']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,856,6,54,87,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15701404289550358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1807678838621933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16700128453350443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4184859501635865,0.14881065883014072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2111961618391811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23244216798425668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15466241412313475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21747215683449828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2073518048413471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20924297508179324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2353484448208518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19790420134960424,0.14811801312878775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20924297508179324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2692396395982574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44897624465751607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1628915958758398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

While by itself, this would make for 396 unique combinations, the game integrates seamlessly with the characters and scenarios from the first collection, yielding a total of 3,312 unique games -- or to put it another way, tremendous solo replayability.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;     07: Master the Trials&#10;     08: Beat the Odds&#10;     09: Control the Skies&#10;     10: Sell the Junk&#10;     11: Destroy the Order&#10;     12: Serve the Rabble&#10;&#10;&#10;",1,1,15,30,"['Push Your Luck', 'Set Collection', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Variable Phase Order']",8,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Card Game', 'Dice', 'Science Fiction']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1229,8,86,125,0.14801369686213156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3303276957868099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12254472365057269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4479584421803238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15066607687947708,0.1632901800932082,0.1425829084906425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13296819512625277,0.0,0.24947217851597675,0.0,0.09600900647801196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1691748880040339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11782731411535076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11104876664950121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10789460986192492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10944283282100448,0.14801369686213156,0.15205611903525287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13032935614292737,0.1661321486407232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27351711155868835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15893419409116435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12254472365057269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15893419409116435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14737535081782938,0.1661321486407232,0.0,0.1632901800932082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24438018288747632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11445218534327185,0.0,0.0,0.12744202747974048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14491253366627999,0.0,0.0

Compete to assemble the most powerful Chili Pepper Gangs (sets of cards) and become the most respected mafia boss. In Chili Mafia, you will find existing Chili Peppers from around the world that are the main characters of the game. Just to mention a few, such well-known Chilies as the Jalape&ntilde;o, the Tabasco or the Carolina Reaper clash with each other. To reflect hierarchy, each pepper carries points that are in proportion to the respective Chili Pepper's strength on the Scoville scale. Moreover, the game includes various action and attack cards (inspired by Mafia jargon) that will not necessarily serve your interest. To win, score the most points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;[CLASSIFIED INFORMATION]&#10;&#10;Things are heating up in the world. Chili peppers are splitting into factions, leading to organized crime and unrest. The Chili Mafia reigns supreme.&#10;The Ministry of International Chili Security has hired you&mdash;a group of agents&mdash;to work undercover and round up the most wanted chili pepper mafiosi from around the globe. Your goal is to bring them to Mexico for a peace summit.  As you arrive in the Chihuahuan desert, the spicy criminals jump out of your luggage. It&rsquo;s obvious they have no interest in peace. Instead, they want a showdown. You and your fellow agents have no choice but to seize control of the Chili Mafia. But to gain their respect, you must fight amongst yourselves to determine who will be the most powerful mafia boss.

(Poetic Edda &ndash; V&ouml;luspa &ndash; The Prophecy of the Seeress, stanza 1).&#10;&#10;Nine worlds, one destination. Driven by the call of the Nordic gods, 2 to 4 jarls, rulers of Viking villages, embark on an adventurous journey through the nine worlds of Yggdrasil to Asgard. But only the most glorious of them will be admitted to their halls. And so the players set off - with only a handful of mostly inexperienced residents of their villages at first - to experience adventures on land and at sea.&#10;&#10;The Norse mythical world of the Vikings consists of 9 different worlds that players will get to know in this &quot;deck building game&quot;, such as Midgard, the world of humans, or J&ouml;tunheim, the realm of the frost giants. During their travels, other Vikings will join the players, they will learn about mysterious places, seek the help of the gods, fight against dangerous opponents and try to escape overpowering dangers without damage.&#10;&#10;The basic game, briefly explained by a &ldquo;tutorial&rdquo;, has a modular structure and can be expanded almost as much as desired with additional game material. So little by little, new and more demanding rules come into play. While always 8 adventures (rounds) will be played, these can be put together from 35 different adventures almost any way the players want. Since players choose to play adventures from 3 of the 9 Viking worlds and because each world features other Vikings with different skills and other special rules, players can also adjust the level of difficulty and the duration of the game by their choice of Viking worlds.&#10;&#10;With each adventure, players learn more about the legends of Nordic mythology, which graphic artist Michael Menzel brought to life with atmospheric illustrations on various cards, amongst them 34 different Vikings.&#10;&#10;From the adventure cards that are placed on the gameboard, players will learn more about the secrets and mythical characters of Nordic mythology. The cards also show a section of the journey ahead. Playing their Viking cards skillfully, players move their Viking figures over this path, collect gold, get glory (victory points) and try to avoid the dangers of the path. With gold they can recruit other Vikings with better skills, filling the card deck with increasingly helpful Vikings. Vikings who fought bravely can be sent to Walhalla. This creates a second deck of cards with Vikings who will assist the players in the often-decisive final adventure at the rainbow bridge Bifr&ouml;st and can also help them win with the victory points they contain.&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,90,"['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']",12,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Mythology'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2771,19,115,244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10670625754682052,0.3444601317045546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10773925620749435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11048925885268492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08350710539597635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1038052185818853,0.08397883156307381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09405751842781492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10289745236926368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10474135703677709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22449429573422072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26697751304174255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11760847373932626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10991868936268478,0.11688665585916125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15072320982350945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22577371504199742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18550993141858166,0.10935878534993362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11834811607258325,0.0,0.11107090805153606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11688665585916125,0.11166407580178363,0.0,0.0,0.2366962321451665,0.0,0.10670625754682052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08645577860239012,0.0,0.10773925620749435,0.0,0.1794534667579633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11549319565800127,0.0,0.0,0.09834396003030074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09576964112941735,0.10991868936268478,0.0,0.0,0.07816308375544864,0.08213492689556043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11549319565800127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09181392520176765,0.09758559059887999,0.16989034637840683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10158538893704254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07413882319253964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11688665585916125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08519170949891638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10245368140021698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18550993141858166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09150670207230144,0.0,0.0,0.159131736313391,0.094730670184298,0.0,0.08859625987623036,0.0,0.08832018425799915,0.0,0.0,0.08191221960543074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10670625754682052,0.0,0.2512261196253366,0.0

Most pictures wins.&#10;&#10;Ages 6 and up&#10;&#10;",2,8,10,10,['Pattern Recognition'],6,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"[""Children's Game"", 'Fantasy']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,522,6,22,64,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28677081988039743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3432646702752921,0.0,0.3710242379517512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2803772752186094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23335031610716733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21986350548458455,0.0,0.0,0.36435108411150025,0.33194380681118935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3165100660531307,0.0,0.3010231424332369,0.0,0.21711096877191022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The rules include detailed treatment of movement, terrain, search and destroy operations, special operations, firepower, airmobility, riverines, brigade-level formations, limited intelligence, and auxiliary units in each scenario.&quot;&#10;That's the blurb from the back of the original Victory Games edition of the game.&#10;&#10;There are several small scenarios and a couple of campaign games. Each year is divided into four seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter), and each season has two turns (so, roughly 6 weeks per turn). The map scale is roughly 6 miles per hex and units are, generally, battalions or regiments. During the operational phase, players take turns (who gets to operate is determined by the NLF player) conducting operations with their units to destroy the enemy, clear the roads, take towns and cities, or just reposition units. In the Campaign Game, during Seasonal Interphases, each player decides whether and how many additional units and/or resources to bring in to the fight. The game features hidden VC units, airmobility, riverines, national morale, pacification, ARVN effectiveness, and many other nuances that allow the player to grasp the some of the experience of what it might have been like to conduct the war in Vietnam.&#10;&#10;An updated reimplementation of the Victory Games' classic.&#10;This edition changes some of the rules as well as clarifications.

451,15016,4784,Test Match,1977,5.53063,90,1.0,"Players play out a live-action cricket game with miniature figures on a fabric playing field. One player 'bowls' a small ball from a bowler while the other player operates the batsman. Fielders are placed throughout the board to 'catch' the ball in the base between their feet.&#10;&#10;A classic and beloved family game originally released in 1977 and immensely popular in the UK, Australia, India and South Africa in particular. The game has undergone a number of changes and additions over the years, but basically layout and game play has stayed the same.&#10;&#10;In some versions, the Bowler figure has a long tilting 'chute' that the ball rolls down after pushing on the bowlers arm. In others the figure is spring loaded and pressing a lever makes the figure 'throw' the ball, with a setting for fast or slow bowling. The balls themselves have changed from small metal ball bearings to two sizes/weights - for both variety in play and for easier game play for younger players.&#10;The Batsman figure in some editions has a string with which you pull back the bat to release it to hit the ball, others have a slide mechanism and some have a trigger mechanism to move the bat. &#10;The fielding player figures are a variety of colours in different versions and may be white, yellow or blue. Additionally in a couple of versions (like Super Cricket) they had magnetic bases to further help 'field' the ball.  &#10;The player figures in one version (One Day Cricket) came entirely unpainted and could be painted the colours of your favourite teams. Later editions include an actual Wicket Keeper figure rather than a 'W' shape part of the batter mechanism.&#10;&#10;The playing 'field' also has changed shape and fabric. In some editions it is very thin light fabric (and in older games, the flocking on the underside completely disintegrates and moults off!) in others it is thicker, crease resistant neoprene. The boundary 'fence' is either white L shaped angled plastic flat or picket shaped strips with green joiner pieces or in more recent versions, a simple rope length.&#10;&#10;In the different versions players can simulate a one-day international, a Twenty/20 series or a full five-day test match. &#10;As well as being featured on box graphics, some well known cricket players have even lent their names to some versions, like Freddie Truman, Mike Atherton, AB De Villiers &amp; Jonty Rhodes.&#10;&#10;It is very difficult to date many of the earlier games accurately as there are no dates on the boxes (very annoying). The date '1977' on the included rule sheet ACTUALLY refers to the copyright date of the ORIGINAL games release by Peter Pan Playthings and NOT that particular versions release. Guesstimates can be made by the box imagery, design and playing piece inclusions.&#10;&#10;&#10;World Cup Cricket is touted as &quot;The original action-packed table-top cricket game!&quot; for Ages 4 and up.&#10;In the box (decorated with action shots of late 80s / early 90s players including Alec Stewart and Jack Russell) comes with a green beize (?? beige) playing area which is laid out on a table, with six boundary fence sections which Velcro around the edge to act as the boundary and prevent the ball flying off around the room. The batsman attached at one end and the bowler to the other.&#10;&#10;The pitch (although octagonal) resembles an archery target -the closer to the boundary and further from the batsmen, the higher the ring value. Directly in front of the batsmen is an area worth no runs, outside of that 1 run, then a ring worth 2 runs and the outer area worth 3 runs. Hitting the fence gets 4 runs and there are four small areas jutting out of the boundary worth 6 runs.&#10;&#10;The bowling player places fielders (with a catching 'cup' between their legs) around the field in an attempt to 'catch' the batsman out. Bowling is achieved by loading the ball into the bowler's cupped hand and pushing down on the front arm, causing the ball to roll down a ramp towards the batsman.&#10;&#10;The batsman is controlled with cord attached to the bat. The batting player pulls back the cord, releasing it in time to hit the approaching ball. Whichever area the ball is hit to is the number of runs the player gets.&#10;Batsmen can be out by being caught by the bowler, by hitting the ball between the legs of the fielders into their 'cups', by the ball hitting the stumps behind the batsmen or by the batsman edging the ball into the &quot;wicket keeper&quot; which is attached to the batting stand.&#10;&#10;There are earlier versions of the game where the batting action is different and the players less detailed.&#10;&#10;",2,2,90,90,['Simulation'],0,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Action / Dexterity', ""Children's Game"", 'Sports']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,4657,38,210,351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20895457915924076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07140905090365582,0.0,0.17211508718706428,0.07398251494489473,0.0,0.0,0.11709950729577481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20042309702490801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0695041180658207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07101234594830763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12595819344833226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055732158678318544,0.0,0.04157009197443889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05718231936728671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07181428779910216,0.0687929850143241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051667607472034915,0.04892437400687144,0.14530376599802103,0.07308506964897807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15458253521494075,0.0,0.13689447211801112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04729497021233366,0.058348224567650264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07222843170931369,0.0,0.06914519693982601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07181428779910216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0687929850143241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11181488340805971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0671243919989048,0.0,0.0,0.07181428779910216,0.0,0.0,0.044989089266912946,0.0,0.046745578835347634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054385672470342185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09306046065399881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1294568676160809,0.19948872255887143,0.06285597921332504,0.0,0.0,0.06810771715478851,0.0,0.06024462932686737,0.06914519693982601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20667042988813966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06260305206829772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07101234594830763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05980640517135319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06987000896788333,0.0,0.0,0.05814882811028732,0.2023394964190432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11833521074661627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07222843170931369,0.0,0.0,0.04384095004182852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06618984728288195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06390307021478356,0.14617013929795614,0.0,0.06260305206829772,0.5955823411463778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11111698237468702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05267857425229732,0.2794800358715333

Be careful not to crash them! You score 1 point for every tile crossed by each train, and looping through tiles multiple times can help your score. Additionally, the farthest stations are the most valuable--until the first trains arrive.

The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",3,4,30,45,"['Hand Management', 'Set Collection', 'Team-Based Game']",10,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,['Card Game'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1220,7,65,109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13295941013885457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14476626843255097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11761570476789666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1430694474741995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1265786440487693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474655382525336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2207875475059851,0.0,0.0,0.10464031037614831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14564451207857437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18736292887596456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11074097284131068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1430694474741995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1843333486880246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2921811077348949,0.0,0.26591882027770913,0.11803744521951832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11440308767274991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13767315077362052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128213517054566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.468794706394774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08950687954922824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11557565424638455,0.0,0.10903640115448242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22957972906265328,0.37973593214630796,0.14476626843255097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09914161681341176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08575259844997937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It is upon the Heroes to explore the dungeons, fight back waves of Monsters and assault Monster encampments.&#10;&#10;Dungeon Crawl features a vast, flexible game system with many different play modes.  Play through the 35 Adventure Campaign with the Dungeon Lord, who fields and plays as the Monsters during the Campaign.  Pit your Heroes against your friends' own characters in the Deathblow Arena.  Play solo or with friends in randomly generated dungeons that don't require a game master, and fight mighty and cruel bosses that will test the Heroes like no other Monster has.&#10;&#10;Combat, the bread and butter of any dungeon crawler, is quick and simple, requiring only two rolls (attack and defense) to figure out if the player has hit, and how much damage he caused.  Gameplay is streamlined for quick play, so you don't have to sit around for hours on end on a single scenario.  Each player can take their turn in just seconds, so you don't have to constantly wait for minutes for someone to make up their minds.&#10;&#10;Players advance in levels to learn Skills, chosen from a list based on the Hero's Race and Class.  Try different Race and Class combinations for interesting skill sets!  Heroes can join Guilds to earn benefits, and must face trials to advance in Guild rank.&#10;&#10;Dungeons are built from 20 available dungeon tiles, each complete with rooms and corridors.  In the dungeons the players will search for treasures in all sorts of different furniture, and fight over 50 different monsters.  Roll on charts or use the included cards to search for treasure or lay out the dungeons.&#10;&#10;Customize your games with a slew of optional rules.  Don't like the Heroes walking around with 50,000 gold in their pockets?  Bring in the Load rules.  Decided that traveling five weeks to another city shouldn't be a cakewalk?  Invoke the Travel rules to add some peril to their journey.&#10;&#10;Think your gaming group might not be up to more advanced modes of play?

462,16200,3067,James Clavell's Shogun Card Game,1983,5.52519,60,2.0,"In this mini-series tie-in card game, 3-7 players in the basic game and 3-8 players in the advanced game try to score points by collecting cards not unlike in traditional card games. The artwork features characters from the movie &quot;Shogun&quot;, and the game can be played in a simple (beginner) or an advanced version, which makes use of all the cards.&#10;&#10;There are two &quot;colors&quot; of cards, peasants and samurai, which are organized into several subclasses like Farmer, Servant, Samurai Wife, or Hatamoto, which all have different point values. Basically, you try to score points by getting either a complete hand of one color (but no doubles), or several cards of the same type. Furthermore, there are wild cards like the Priest, the Emperor, the Heir and of course the Shogun which all have special values in certain combinations. Several other cards like a joker (the &quot;Buddha&quot;) or an elimination card (the &quot;Ninja&quot;) are also part of the deck. Unlike many other card games, you don't hold the cards in your hand; four of your five cards are displayed face up in front of you, while the fifth lies face down to be kept secret till the end of the turn. This makes bluffing as important a factor as luck and strategy in this game.&#10;&#10;But that's not all. Right before the end (and before revealing their face-down card), players can choose a final strategy, represented by small strategy markers. &quot;Passive&quot; means you get the points your hand is worth (if any), while &quot;Power Play&quot; can double your score (or even turn a zero point hand into 20 points), but only if either you're the only one to play &quot;Power Play&quot;, or if you're the player with the highest score this round. For every other &quot;Power Player&quot; there's a hefty point penalty.&#10;&#10;There are even more special cards that I won't go into detail about (such as the &quot;Spy&quot; or the &quot;Hostage&quot;), as well as an intricate turn sequence that allows players to play their cards almost simultaneously. Also, the deck is only reshuffled when all the cards have been used up, which may take a few rounds and will make sure that certain powerful cards only show up ever so often, and not always in the right order to be played.&#10;&#10;Another noteworthy part of this game is it's unique atmosphere. The rules successfully impose a courteous oriental gameplay where cards aren't simply dealt, but offered, and where Favors can be used to influence a hand.

The New York King's throne is vacant. Rather than collapsing into fights between families, each family will send his or her best wiseguy into the city and its suburbs to find out who has more moxie, and in turn which family will rise. Money talks in this world, so the only goal in this game is to prove your wiseguy's worth by making the most money you can in one night. In simpler game terms, the player with the most money at the end of the game will be the new King of New York.&#10;&#10;The game board represents the connected districts of the city of Manhattan. During the game, missions will be available to different players. These mission smartphone cards show how many characters are necessary for its implementation, the location where the mission may be accepted and where it must be completed, whether or not it is a dangerous mission (NYPD watch!), and of course the amount of money you can make.&#10;&#10;During your turn you will begin a phase of corruption. Each player secretly tries to buy the first position player AND the right to control the police. Then players pick &quot;resources&quot; cards, which will be used to generate events or increase movements. Next, each player moves his characters &mdash; his wiseguy and his henchmen &mdash; then plays the actions he choose. Players can accept a mission, complete a mission, provoke opposing characters, or try to recruit new henchmen.&#10;&#10;Provocation is a kind of &quot;Texas Hold'em&quot; poker duel with die. You first bet, then throw three dice (the &quot;flop&quot;). Either one folds and loses his bet down or the provocation goes on until the shootout (fifth dice). Just like in poker, the weaker hand loses the pot and one of his characters.&#10;&#10;When a character or characters are stopped by the police during a dangerous mission, these situations are also managed through die rolls.&#10;&#10;",2,5,90,90,"['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Pick-up and Deliver']",13,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Dice', 'Mafia']",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2020,19,90,179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0809406481557356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0967641061795643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09318573941366658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11770526082179945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1093875899110377,0.5320682658127409,0.08608906543460108,0.0,0.0,0.19635231280031157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10042399000351264,0.0,0.0,0.10161278419387067,0.0,0.0,0.10327300913057966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1777882279598917,0.2177429981679235,0.0684215419589257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09082252124474005,0.0,0.06774366274391333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23406072307216125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09965628298257775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09642101119812216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07707306766407522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12132198696980136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0911081668523038,0.0,0.0,0.11770526082179945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07913974037983536,0.11770526082179945,0.07331534633908396,0.0,0.07617776572007566,0.15378381355295698,0.0,0.0,0.4237793590413316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09082252124474005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2187751798220754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09574611191240333,0.0,0.10003773734612406,0.09380609751030171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07363857754876148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09508572772096618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0911081668523038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11982380294411797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08584632360621558,0.11386191607045097

The conflict has long since spread worldwide. Other than the three great blocs, there are but a handful of countries left hanging on to relative neutrality.&#10;&#10;As the conflict grew longer, old alliances were broken while new ones were formed. Nowadays, the leading powers of the past are assembled into three huge states:&#10;&#10;&bull; The Allies have gathered around the U.S.A. This great coalition of nations includes, among others, the British Commonwealth and the French colonial empire.&#10;&bull; To secure their survival against their powerful enemies, Germany, Japan, and Italy have merged as the Axis. The rise of this totalitarian state was helped by the successful assassination of the F&uuml;hrer in 1943 following operation Walkyrie.&#10;&bull; The USSR and communist China have united their fates to build the SSU, or Sino-Soviet Union. Becoming a planetary power, the communist bloc intends to impose its way of life on all other continents.&#10;&#10;Throughout the world, the three blocs are fighting to gain exclusive control over a revolutionary ore: Vk.

Crossing the Egyptian border into Libya their mission is simple:  destroy the Afrika Korps, and lift the siege of Tobruk!  The Axis forces in the path of the Allied advance occupy well-prepared strongpoints, and lurking somewhere behind them are the German panzers &ndash; and Rommel, &ldquo;The Desert Fox.&rdquo;  The next three days of battle will decide the course of the war in the desert for months to come.&#10;&#10;Utilizing a new and streamlined version of the &ldquo;area-impulse&rdquo; system players will experience the uncertainty of the desert battlefield.  Each turn will contain a variable number of impulses, and both players will be challenged to determine whether it is better to attack first, or defend and then counter-attack.  Having committed one&rsquo;s infantry and armor to battle, artillery support may or may not be available.

Gameplay includes trick-taking, publicly visible suits, and simultaneous bidding.&#10;&#10;Played across 6 rounds, each round players are dealt a hand that increases by 1 card (1x card in round 1, 2x cards in round 2, etc.)&#10;&#10;With all suits openly visible to all players, everyone must try to predict how many tricks they will win in the round - they bid simultaneously by revealing a number of fingers.&#10;&#10;The bids are recorded and the trick-taking phase commences.&#10;&#10;Everyone plays their cards using standard must-follow trick-taking rules, however, the highest card wins the trick, regardless of suit.  BUT... if cards of the same number are played, they cancel each other out and the next highest card wins the trick.  This often leads to surprise outcomes and plenty of laughs and groans.&#10;&#10;Points are awarded based on whether players correctly predicted their bids or not:&#10;&#10;     If your Bid and Tricks match EXACTLY, score points equal to the Current Round&#10;     If your Bid and Tricks DO NOT MATCH, score -1 point per Difference&#10;&#10;&#10;The dealer moves clockwise.

481,19587,344659,The Game of Saying 'Huh?!',2017,5.51213,15,1.0,"From the creator of video game classic Puyo Puyo comes a party game to test your acting abilities.&#10;&#10;Use only facial expressions and the tone of your voice (and sometimes less than that) to portray different scenarios.&#10;&#10;Does that &ldquo;Ha-&ldquo; sound angry, heartbroken, or curious? Players draw a card that determines a topic sound like &ldquo;Ha-&ldquo; or &ldquo;Eh&rdquo; along with a list of eight different scenarios. Individual players then draw a card that assigns them a scenario from the list to enact. Without using any body gestures, players act out their scenario to each other and try to guess who was assigned what.&#10;&#10;The Game of Saying &lsquo;Huh&rsquo; will test your skills of wit and mimicry and bring plenty of laughter and fun to game nights. The game is played in rounds using a different Task card for each round. At the top is a single word or a short phrase you will each have to say, but each of you in a unique way. There are 8 ways listed on the Task card from A to H and you&rsquo;ll be secretly assigned one of them at random. You might have to say &lsquo;Hello!&rsquo; like you&rsquo;re talking to a pet, like you&rsquo;re a vampire or like you&rsquo;re the president. There are lots of common phrases and sayings, as well as a few actions thrown in for good measure. But here&rsquo;s the tricky part: you can only use your voice and facial expression to convey the meaning of what&rsquo;s on the card. Gestures or movement of any kind below the neck are not allowed. When you&rsquo;ve finished making your impression, everybody votes in secret, assigning the correct lettered task to your performance.&#10;&#10;When everyone&rsquo;s finished acting their part, it&rsquo;s time for the big reveal: you&rsquo;ll score if you guessed correctly who acted out which cue, and collect points yourself when others correctly identify your performance.

These increase the ability to have more players and include all of these great additional cards to the game with hilarious references and images by Randy Martinez.&#10;&#10;Sitting Ducks Gallery is a hysterically fun, stick-it-to-your-neighbor, line manipulation game invented by Keith Meyers. Sitting Ducks is reminiscent of the classic carnival-style, midway shooting galleries, where players are trying to take out as many ducks as possible. Players move ducks and targets, take aim, and eventually eliminate other players&rsquo; ducks using a variety of humorous Action Cards, while trying to keep their own safe.  The goal is to be the last duck in the pond!&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#10;In Sitting Ducks, each player gets their own group of ducks. Those ducks are shuffled together and form the Duck Deck, which then become the Duck line.&#10;&#10;The Duck line is always in flux - when a Duck is removed; the other ducks move forward to fill the gap.  Certain cards can move the line forward, backwards or rearrange ducks in the line in your favor or your opponents. With the right cards, players may also move and manipulate targets to try to keep their own Ducks safe.&#10;&#10;Eventually, you&rsquo;ll get caught snoozing and you will surely lose some of your ducks.&#10;&#10;Lose all of your ducks, and you can no longer win the game.  But, one of the most fun aspects of Sitting Ducks is when all of your ducks have been eliminated from the game. Although you won&rsquo;t win, you&rsquo;ll still get a chance to exact revenge on the opponents who took you out and play Action Cards for the rest of the game! The last player to have a duck in the water is the winner!&#10;&#10;",3,6,20,0,"['Hand Management', 'Open Drafting']",10,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Animals', 'Card Game']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1899,16,90,157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22750584150479672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09744504506612263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09838838806546302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08745763566609628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09276862510791581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06833668823751948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08193920186840402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21093870058719513,0.0,0.10252519570334404,0.0,0.13764169329355477,0.09936542892679245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08589411092394911,0.0,0.0,0.09016148795537283,0.10674186978047304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10807648744614054,0.0,0.0,0.17755233467082127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17621791554004088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5304910550043849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19397059837008965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0653110397062468,0.0,0.06786095040275017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31580855465538354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17961705034831227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08015736602327922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08911597587929271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35646390351717083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10740103989363486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0935615570329014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08470460890901914,0.18249710856874984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07757264119153957,0.0,0.0,0.08412870898500212,0.0,0.10609821100087698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14960584532570678,0.08713769943402914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

489,18017,28253,C.S.A. America's Civil War 1861-1865,2008,5.51788,180,2.5,"C.S.A. is a simulation game of the American Civil war. The USA player controls the Union side and the CSA player controls the Confederate side. The Game contains the rulebook, 288 counters, one color map and 10 sheets of charts and tables.&#10;&#10;The game uses Ben Madison and Wes Erni's &quot;Charles S. Roberts Award&quot; winning Death in the Trenches: The Great War, 1914-1918 system to simulate the American Civil War. Units represent Generals (their component brigades are represented off-map), elite units (Iron Brigade, Cobb's Legion), cavalry (Stuart, Stoneman), guerillas (Quantrill, Kirk), and Indians (Choctaws, Delawares, Stand Watie). Like Death in the Trenches: The Great War, 1914-1918 random events and &quot;Special Event Coins&quot; are crucial, and there are about 400 (yes, 400) of them.&#10;&#10;Forming stacks into 'Grand Armies' (e.g. Army of the Potomac, Army of Northern Virginia) enables the various commanders in the stack to coordinate their fighting powers. Cavalry have special abilities but also a habit of running away when you need them. Guerillas ravage the countryside (Quantrill, Price, Morgan -- and the less widely known Union barbarian, George Kirk). Generals do not always follow orders to move, and sometimes must be prodded by expending irreplaceable command chits. Special rules cover foreign intervention, the border states, as well as McClellan, Lee, Jackson and a few other characters. Naval warfare (Confederate commerce raiding) is handled by an extremely simple, elegant abstract model complete with a world map.&#10;&#10;The game is won by either capturing the government marker of either player or destroying his economy. Capturing cities and winning naval battles increases the enemy's inflation rate, which affects a lot of elements like national elections (there are three over the course of the game--one in the Confederacy!) and reinforcement rates.&#10;&#10;",1,2,180,180,"['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Movement Points', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Simulation', 'Zone of Control']",12,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['American Civil War', 'Civil War', 'Post-Napoleonic', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1918,21,113,193,0.11616951449103567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12163583059699307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13038989943560453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11719436746614316,0.0,0.0,0.12474053790300486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11566850443847998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11059789450993153,0.0,0.12815936190183067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11373554634851227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2000474114482093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22293011789187403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12888664928742485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2006765798923521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3761916305601263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09760713792156253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10262634035096768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12223438710765998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13038989943560453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09590168950280413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2303496173260345,0.0,0.12539721018670877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28854007470373544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12474053790300486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08109886523443714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10330954661799248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5097895478916795,0.0,0.0,0.09971202093702519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23980243307211632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09454337197649267,0.0

It's the kind of game for those nights when you'd like to play something, but don't want to commit to a traditional fantasy sports simulation.&#10;&#10;One of the great mysteries of the sport of Elfball is just where it began, and how it got its name. The Elves of the vast forests of the Westerlands claim to have been playing the sport since the dawn of time, and that they named it in honor of themselves. The Dwarves and Orcs, high in their mountain homes, dispute this bold claim and insist that the game&rsquo;s name instead refers to the type of severed head that makes the best ball core; both races maintain that they are in fact the originators and some of the bloodiest wars in the history of the realms have been fought over this claim. The men of the Middle Kingdoms ignore the squabbles of the elder races and call the game De Circque instead.&#10;&#10;Today Elfball is played by every nation and tribe of the world, and with a few regional variations, it is played the same on fields throughout The Realms. The design of the field, the distinctive ball, and the rules of play are all quite standardized.&#10;&#10;This game was prototyped in 2002 by Phigs Miniatures but did not see production until the game rules were overhauled and changed about 80% from the prototype and then released by Impact!

Bids are valued based on the size of a suit (e.g., three-of-a-kind beats two-of-a-kind, etc.), and if the size matches, you compare suits: Gold, Silver, Crystal, Marble. If size and suit match, compare a secondary bid (3 gold and 2 marble beats 3 gold and a silver).&#10;&#10;The highest bidder activates the card's special effect and adds it to their discard pile.

Players take the role of the Field Commander of an army of the period, attempting to fulfill victory conditions using mounted and foot arms of the period.&#10;&#10;Players use arms of the period including men-at-arms, both mounted and dismounted, infantry including archers, and when available, early firearms.&#10;&#10;Order of Arms is descended from and related to the 3rd edition of the grand tactical Napoleonic game Eagles of the Empire. Players familiar with that game will recognize many features of that system present here in Order of Arms. However (and this is a BIG however), there are significant differences between Eagles of the Empire and Order of Arms; most notably the scale at which Order of Arms portrays its combat, and the resulting procedures that emphasize unit to unit fighting. Moreover, where the queen of the battlefield in Napoleon's time was the linear Infantry formation, in Order of Arms, the dominant unit up until near the very end of the period covered, was the Mounted Men-at-Arms (MMA); the armored knight; the result of which is that the long playing piece in Order of Arms is the MMA unit.&#10;&#10;Fornovo 1495, the first game in the series presents the battle fought between the French Army of King Charles VIII, and the Condottieri forces of the League of Venice under the command of Francesco II Gonzaga of Mantua. The game features the Historical Battle as fought by Francesco Gonzaga across a rising Taro River, a free-set up version, and a what-if scenario that portrays the Italian fear of a French drive on Parma.&#10;&#10;Complexity: 5 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10&#10;&#10;Time Scale: 20 minutes per turn&#10;Map Scale: 350 yards per area&#10;Unit Scale: Battalions and Companies&#10;&#10;Players: 1 to 2&#10;Playing Time: 2 to 4 hours&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;1 Series rulebook&#10;1 Game specific rulebook/scenario book&#10;1 Map 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo;&#10;2 Countersheets with both long and square counters&#10;Multiple charts and tables cards&#10;3 Six-sided Dice&#10;1 Box and Lid&#10;&#10;(source: Compass Games website and user's description)&#10;&#10;",1,2,180,180,"['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Movement Points', 'Simulation']",12,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"['Renaissance', 'Wargame']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2364,9,148,205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11799325940998515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0981138996719606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22397440031222568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1103901824756965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11866285551190518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09608263480298557,0.0,0.09013412643187511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.093264479484751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06868864078104975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22850512802594092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0851418550218909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2085682841023215,0.0,0.0,0.22850512802594092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2218269448378518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07433804557424907,0.23090042477243963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11866285551190518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12076264105125105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5535826826431846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2415252821025021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17074668643240556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09511462879287805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19764308838897846,0.07706196909519845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09608263480298557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12301434620259931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11484562991976081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2173227283770344,0.11367058410192098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07036447226624855,0.0,0.09575661068570698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10344260383067622,0.0,0.08270299161615095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The central province contains the players' goal: the Forbidden City, the capital of Zargos. In each game round, a player can perform attacks (with his troops) from the territories he occupies, then rearrange his forces. Controlling a territory give points and these points are used to buy reinforcements and boats. The control of an entire kingdom allows to buy magic cards. These cards have magical effects affecting some aspect of the game. Each race has characteristics and features that confer advantages in combat or reorganization.

But how was the map drawn? How did the wise stranger learn of all these dire warnings? In Overworld, you are the hero's mysterious mentor. All those years before you sent the hero to the underworld, you mapped the Overworld!&#10;&#10;By laying tiles, you will seek to claim regions of Forests or Mountains with your Bird meeples, and regions of Reefs or Whirlpools with your Ship meeples. When the tiles form a hole in the world, the player who explored the most tiles there will place a Dungeon Door meeple into the hole.&#10;&#10;Can you foresee uncertain spots in the geography, indeterminate in the distance? Will you uncover a dungeon... or wander the repeating pixel textures forever?&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY: Players in Overworld will take turns placing L-shaped tiles, one at a time, drawn from a bag. Place it land-side up or water-side up, but water and land may not be adjacent. Or instead, play a Coast tile that connects land to water. When an empty gap is enclosed with tiles, the birds and ships which can enter the gap, without leaving their terrain type, will compete to let their player place a Dungeon Door there.&#10;&#10;The player whose Dungeon Door meeples are the farthest apart has discovered the largest and most valuable dungeon!&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,40,"['Enclosure', 'Modular Board', 'Pattern Building', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Tile Placement']",14,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,"['Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Territory Building', 'Video Game Theme']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1554,18,83,154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14990128290099594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13922445998343683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12554926844047382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11708317497988768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11016587295342806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1422016826117323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13515555152582612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42205162606118346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2813677507074556,0.09412263263387886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28106707957542165,0.0,0.0,0.13515555152582612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25843060466356055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24912751065788163,0.5628506190439247,0.08827413710378489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11083739706001262,0.13922445998343683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13515555152582612,0.0,0.10606877089895421,0.0
